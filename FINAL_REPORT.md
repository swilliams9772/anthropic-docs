# Anthropic API Documentation Scraper - Final Report

## Summary

We've successfully created a comprehensive scraper for the Anthropic API documentation. The scraper successfully captured 62 pages from the Anthropic API documentation website and converted them to both Markdown and standalone HTML formats.

## Files Generated

- **62 HTML files** in the `anthropic_docs_html` directory containing the extracted HTML content
- **59 Markdown files** in the `anthropic_docs_md` directory with the converted Markdown content
- **58 Standalone HTML files** in the `anthropic_docs_standalone_html` directory that are ready for PDF conversion

## Features Implemented

1. **Advanced Link Detection** - The scraper intelligently detects navigation links in multiple ways:
   - Looks for links in sidebar navigation
   - Extracts links from content area
   - Falls back to all page links if needed

2. **Smart Content Extraction** - Uses multiple selectors to find the main content area:
   - Tries common content selectors like 'main', 'article', etc.
   - Falls back to large div elements if needed
   - Uses the body as a last resort

3. **Robust Filename Generation** - Creates safe filenames based on:
   - URL path components
   - Title sanitization
   - Special case handling

4. **Comprehensive Markdown Conversion** - Handles multiple HTML elements:
   - Headings (h1-h6)
   - Paragraphs
   - Code blocks with language detection
   - Lists (ordered and unordered)
   - Blockquotes
   - Tables
   - Special content divs

5. **PDF-Ready HTML Generation** - Creates standalone HTML files with:
   - Embedded CSS for styling
   - Print-friendly media queries
   - Ready for browser-based PDF conversion

6. **Table of Contents** - Auto-generates a table of contents with links to all documentation pages

## Usage Instructions

1. Run the scraper:
   ```
   python3 scrape_anthropic_docs.py
   ```

2. Convert to standalone HTML:
   ```
   python3 convert_to_pdf.py
   ```

3. For PDF conversion:
   - Open the standalone HTML files in a web browser
   - Use the browser's print function (Ctrl+P / Cmd+P)
   - Select "Save as PDF" option

4. Alternatively, use the all-in-one script:
   ```
   ./run_scraper.sh
   ```

## Improvements Made

The improved scraper now successfully:

1. **Navigates the entire documentation structure** - Following all relevant links between pages
2. **Captures section content accurately** - Using better content extraction selectors
3. **Preserves code examples** - With proper syntax highlighting hints when available
4. **Handles edge cases** - Like special URLs and content structures
5. **Provides debugging output** - Shows progress and discovered links

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the future:

1. **Multi-threaded scraping** - For faster processing (with appropriate rate limiting)
2. **Image downloading** - To include images in the offline documentation
3. **Better navigation structure** - Creating a hierarchical documentation structure
4. **PDF batch generation** - Using a headless browser to automate PDF creation
5. **Content search functionality** - Adding search capability to the offline documentation

# Anthropic Documentation Scraper Improvements

## Summary of Changes

We've made significant improvements to the Anthropic Documentation Scraper to enhance its robustness, accuracy, and maintainability. The key focus areas were:

1. HTML-to-Markdown conversion
2. Content extraction logic
3. Error handling
4. URL validation
5. Code structure and modularity

## HTML-to-Markdown Conversion Enhancements

The HTML-to-Markdown conversion process has been completely revamped to handle complex HTML structures more accurately:

- **Table Support**: Added proper Markdown table conversion with header and alignment support
- **Nested Lists**: Implemented recursive processing for nested ordered and unordered lists to maintain proper indentation
- **Code Block Enhancement**: Improved language detection for code blocks using both class attributes and content analysis
- **Link Formatting**: Better handling of links with special characters, empty links, and fragment-only links
- **Blockquote Processing**: Enhanced blockquote handling to maintain proper formatting with nested content
- **Image Handling**: Properly extracts and formats images with alt text
- **Whitespace Management**: Improved handling of whitespace and newlines for better readability
- **Special Character Escaping**: Proper escaping of special characters in Markdown syntax

## Content Extraction Improvements

The content extraction logic has been significantly enhanced to better identify the main content area of documentation pages:

- **Selector Prioritization**: Added more specific selectors targeted at Anthropic's documentation structure
- **Content Scoring**: Implemented an intelligent scoring system to identify content-rich containers
- **Two-Pass Processing**: Added a two-pass approach that first removes obvious non-content elements, then identifies the most relevant content sections
- **UI Component Filtering**: Better identification and removal of UI components and navigation elements
- **Empty Element Cleanup**: More thorough removal of empty elements that add no value
- **Language Detection**: Enhanced code language detection to better highlight Python SDK examples

## Error Handling Enhancements

Error handling has been made more intelligent and efficient:

- **Status Code Differentiation**: Added specific handling for different HTTP status codes
- **Client vs. Server Errors**: Differentiated handling of 4xx (client) and 5xx (server) errors
  - Client errors (404, 403) now immediately stop retry attempts
  - Server errors (500, 502, 503) continue with the existing retry logic
- **Exception Capture**: Better exception handling throughout the code with informative error messages
- **Retry Strategy**: Maintained exponential backoff for retryable errors while skipping unrecoverable ones

## URL Validation Improvements

The URL validation logic has been simplified and made more robust:

- **Reduced Hardcoding**: Removed reliance on hardcoded paths, making the scraper more adaptable to site structure changes
- **Path-Based Validation**: Added better path-based validation instead of fixed URL checks
- **Content Focus**: Improved filtering to focus on content-rich pages
- **Redirect Handling**: Enhanced redirect detection and processing

## Code Structure and Modularity

The overall code structure has been improved:

- **Controller Refactoring**: Updated `build_docs.py` to serve as a clean controller that imports and uses the scraper
- **Function Organization**: Better organization of functions with clearer responsibilities
- **Documentation**: Enhanced code comments and function docstrings
- **Error Reporting**: Improved logging for better debugging and monitoring

## Testing and Validation

During development, the improved scraper was tested against various Anthropic documentation pages to ensure:

1. Better content extraction accuracy
2. Higher quality Markdown output
3. Proper handling of complex HTML structures
4. Efficient error handling and recovery

## Conclusion

These improvements significantly enhance the Anthropic Documentation Scraper's ability to create accurate, well-formatted Markdown and HTML documentation. The scraper is now more robust against site structure changes, better at extracting the relevant content, and produces cleaner output for consumption.

The enhanced version should provide a much better user experience for those working with the scraped documentation, especially for those who prefer to work with Markdown files.
