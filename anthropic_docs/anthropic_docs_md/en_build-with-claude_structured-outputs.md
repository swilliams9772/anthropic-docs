Structured outputs constrain Claude's responses to follow a specific schema, ensuring valid, parseable output for downstream processing. Structured outputs provide two complementary features:

* **JSON outputs** (`output_config.format`): Get Claude's response in a specific JSON format
* **Strict tool use** (`strict: true`): Guarantee schema validation on tool names and inputs

You can use these features independently or together in the same request.

Structured outputs are generally available on the Claude API for [Claude Mythos Preview](https://anthropic.com/glasswing), Claude Opus 4.7, Claude Opus 4.6, Claude Sonnet 4.6, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Opus 4.5, and Claude Haiku 4.5. On Amazon Bedrock, structured outputs are generally available for Claude Opus 4.6, Claude Sonnet 4.6, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Opus 4.5, and Claude Haiku 4.5; Claude Opus 4.7 and Claude Mythos Preview are available through [Claude in Amazon Bedrock](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-in-amazon-bedrock) (the Messages-API Bedrock endpoint). Structured outputs are available on [Claude Platform on AWS](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-platform-on-aws) and in beta on [Microsoft Foundry](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-in-microsoft-foundry). On [Vertex AI](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-on-vertex-ai), structured outputs are generally available for Claude Mythos Preview, Claude Opus 4.7, Claude Opus 4.6, and Claude Sonnet 4.6.

This feature qualifies for [Zero Data Retention (ZDR)](/docs/en/build-with-claude/api-and-data-retention) with limited technical retention. See the [Data retention](#data-retention) section for details on what is retained and why.

**Migrating from beta?** The `output_format` parameter has moved to `output_config.format`, and beta headers are no longer required. The old beta header (`structured-outputs-2025-11-13`) and `output_format` parameter will continue working for a transition period. See the following code examples for the updated API shape.

# Why use structured outputs

Without structured outputs, Claude can generate malformed JSON responses or invalid tool inputs that break your applications. Even with careful prompting, you may encounter:

* Parsing errors from invalid JSON syntax
* Missing required fields
* Inconsistent data types
* Schema violations requiring error handling and retries

Structured outputs guarantee schema-compliant responses through constrained decoding:

* **Always valid:** No more `JSON.parse()` errors
* **Type safe:** Guaranteed field types and required fields
* **Reliable:** No retries needed for schema violations

# JSON outputs

JSON outputs control Claude's response format, ensuring Claude returns valid JSON matching your schema. Use JSON outputs when you need to:

* Control Claude's response format
* Extract data from images or text
* Generate structured reports
* Format API responses

# Quick start

```
client = anthropic.Anthropic()

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-7",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Extract the key information from this email: John Smith (john@example.com) is interested in our Enterprise plan and wants to schedule a demo for next Tuesday at 2pm.",
        }
    ],
    output_config={
        "format": {
            "type": "json_schema",
            "schema": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "name": {"type": "string"},
                    "email": {"type": "string"},
                    "plan_interest": {"type": "string"},
                    "demo_requested": {"type": "boolean"},
                },
                "required": ["name", "email", "plan_interest", "demo_requested"],
                "additionalProperties": False,
            },
        }
    },
)
print(response.content[0].text)
```

**Response format:** Valid JSON matching your schema in `response.content[0].text`

Output

```
{
  "name": "John Smith",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "plan_interest": "Enterprise",
  "demo_requested": true
}
```

# How it works

1. 1

   Define your JSON schema

   Create a JSON schema that describes the structure you want Claude to follow. The schema uses standard JSON Schema format with some limitations (see [JSON Schema limitations](#json-schema-limitations)).
2. 2

   Add the output\_config.format parameter

   Include the `output_config.format` parameter in your API request with `type: "json_schema"` and your schema definition.
3. 3

   Parse the response

   Claude's response is valid JSON matching your schema, returned in `response.content[0].text`.

# Working with JSON outputs in SDKs

The SDKs provide helpers that make it easier to work with JSON outputs, including schema transformation, automatic validation, and integration with popular schema libraries.

The Python SDK's `client.messages.parse()` still accepts `output_format` as a convenience parameter and translates it to `output_config.format` internally. Other SDKs require `output_config` directly. The following examples show the SDK helper syntax.

# Using native schema definitions

Instead of writing raw JSON schemas, you can use familiar schema definition tools in your language:

* **Python:** [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) models with `client.messages.parse()`
* **TypeScript:** [Zod](https://zod.dev/) schemas with `zodOutputFormat()` or typed JSON Schema literals with `jsonSchemaOutputFormat()`
* **Java:** Plain Java classes with automatic schema derivation through `outputConfig(Class<T>)`
* **Ruby:** `Anthropic::BaseModel` classes with `output_config: {format: Model}`
* **PHP:** Classes implementing `StructuredOutputModel` with `outputConfig: ['format' => MyClass::class]`
* **CLI**, **C#**, **Go:** Raw JSON schemas passed through `output_config`

**`client.messages.parse()` (Recommended)**

The `parse()` method automatically transforms your Pydantic model, validates the response, and returns a `parsed_output` attribute.

```
from pydantic import BaseModel
# ...
class ContactInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str
    email: str
    plan_interest: str
# ...
response = client.messages.parse(
    model="claude-opus-4-7",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Extract contact info: John Smith, john@example.com, interested in the Pro plan",
        }
    ],
    output_format=ContactInfo,
)

# Access the parsed output directly
contact = response.parsed_output
print(contact.name, contact.email)
```

**`transform_schema()` helper**

For when you need to manually transform schemas before sending, or when you want to modify a Pydantic-generated schema. Unlike `client.messages.parse()`, which transforms provided schemas automatically, this gives you the transformed schema so you can further customize it.

```
from anthropic import transform_schema
from pydantic import TypeAdapter

# First convert Pydantic model to JSON schema, then transform
schema = TypeAdapter(ContactInfo).json_schema()
schema = transform_schema(schema)
# Modify schema if needed
schema["properties"]["custom_field"] = {"type": "string"}

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-7",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "..."}],
    output_config={
        "format": {"type": "json_schema", "schema": schema},
    },
)
```

# How SDK transformation works

The Python, TypeScript, Ruby, and PHP SDKs automatically transform schemas with unsupported features:

1. **Remove unsupported constraints** (for example, `minimum`, `maximum`, `minLength`, `maxLength`)
2. **Update descriptions** with constraint info (for example, "Must be at least 100"), when the constraint is not directly supported with structured outputs
3. **Add `additionalProperties: false`** to all objects
4. **Filter string formats** to supported list only
5. **Validate responses** against your original schema (with all constraints)

This means Claude receives a simplified schema, but your code still enforces all constraints through validation.

**Example:** A Pydantic field with `minimum: 100` becomes a plain integer in the sent schema, but the SDK updates the description to "Must be at least 100" and validates the response against the original constraint.

# Common use cases

# Data extraction

# Classification

# API response formatting

# Strict tool use

For enforcing JSON Schema compliance on tool inputs with grammar-constrained sampling, see [Strict tool use](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/strict-tool-use).

# Using both features together

JSON outputs and strict tool use solve different problems and work together:

* **JSON outputs** control Claude's response format (what Claude says)
* **Strict tool use** validates tool parameters (how Claude calls your functions)

When combined, Claude can call tools with guaranteed-valid parameters AND return structured JSON responses. This is useful for agentic workflows where you need both reliable tool calls and structured final outputs.

# Important considerations

# Grammar compilation and caching

Structured outputs use constrained sampling with compiled grammar artifacts. This introduces some performance characteristics to be aware of:

* **First request latency:** The first time you use a specific schema, there is additional latency while the grammar compiles
* **Automatic caching:** Compiled grammars are cached for 24 hours from last use, making subsequent requests much faster
* **Cache invalidation:** The cache is invalidated if you change:
  + The JSON schema structure
  + The set of tools in your request (when using both structured outputs and tool use)
  + Changing only `name` or `description` fields does not invalidate the cache

# Prompt modification and token costs

When using structured outputs, Claude automatically receives an additional system prompt explaining the expected output format. This means:

* Your input token count is slightly higher
* The injected prompt costs you tokens like any other system prompt
* Changing the `output_config.format` parameter will invalidate any [prompt cache](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) for that conversation thread

# JSON Schema limitations

Structured outputs support standard JSON Schema with some limitations. Both JSON outputs and strict tool use share these limitations.

# Supported features

# Not supported

# Pattern support (regex)

The Python, TypeScript, Ruby, and PHP SDKs can automatically transform schemas with unsupported features by removing them and adding constraints to field descriptions. See [SDK-specific methods](#sdk-specific-methods) for details.

# Property ordering

When using structured outputs, properties in objects maintain their defined ordering from your schema, with one important caveat: **required properties appear first, followed by optional properties**.

For example, given this schema:

```
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "notes": { "type": "string" },
    "name": { "type": "string" },
    "email": { "type": "string" },
    "age": { "type": "integer" }
  },
  "required": ["name", "email"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

The output will order properties as:

1. `name` (required, in schema order)
2. `email` (required, in schema order)
3. `notes` (optional, in schema order)
4. `age` (optional, in schema order)

This means the output might look like:

```
{
  "name": "John Smith",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "notes": "Interested in enterprise plan",
  "age": 35
}
```

If property order in the output is important to your application, mark all properties as required, or account for this reordering in your parsing logic.

# Invalid outputs

While structured outputs guarantee schema compliance in most cases, there are scenarios where the output may not match your schema:

**Refusals** (`stop_reason: "refusal"`)

Claude maintains its safety and helpfulness properties even when using structured outputs. If Claude refuses a request for safety reasons:

* The response has `stop_reason: "refusal"`
* You'll receive a 200 status code
* You'll be billed for the tokens generated
* The output may not match your schema because the refusal message takes precedence over schema constraints

**Token limit reached** (`stop_reason: "max_tokens"`)

If the response is cut off due to reaching the `max_tokens` limit:

* The response has `stop_reason: "max_tokens"`
* The output may be incomplete and not match your schema
* Retry with a higher `max_tokens` value to get the complete structured output

# Schema complexity limits

Structured outputs work by compiling your JSON schemas into a grammar that constrains Claude's output. More complex schemas produce larger grammars that take longer to compile. To protect against excessive compilation times, the API enforces several complexity limits.

# Explicit limits

The following limits apply to all requests with `output_config.format` or `strict: true`:

| Limit | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Strict tools per request | 20 | Maximum number of tools with `strict: true`. Non-strict tools don't count toward this limit. |
| Optional parameters | 24 | Total optional parameters across all strict tool schemas and JSON output schemas. Each parameter not listed in `required` counts toward this limit. |
| Parameters with union types | 16 | Total parameters that use `anyOf` or type arrays (for example, `"type": ["string", "null"]`) across all strict schemas. These are especially expensive because they create exponential compilation cost. |

These limits apply to the combined total across all strict schemas in a single request. For example, if you have 4 strict tools with 6 optional parameters each, you'll reach the 24-parameter limit even though no single tool seems complex.

# Additional internal limits

Beyond the explicit limits in the preceding table, there are additional internal limits on the compiled grammar size. These limits exist because schema complexity doesn't reduce to a single dimension: features like optional parameters, union types, nested objects, and number of tools interact with each other in ways that can make the compiled grammar disproportionately large.

When these limits are exceeded, you'll receive a 400 error with the message "Schema is too complex for compilation." These errors mean the combined complexity of your schemas exceeds what can be efficiently compiled, even if each individual limit in the preceding table is satisfied. As a final stop-gap, the API also enforces a **compilation timeout of 180 seconds**. Schemas that pass all explicit checks but produce very large compiled grammars may hit this timeout.

# Tips for reducing schema complexity

If you're hitting complexity limits, try these strategies in order:

1. **Mark only critical tools as strict.** If you have many tools, reserve it for tools where schema violations cause real problems, and rely on Claude's natural adherence for simpler tools.
2. **Reduce optional parameters.** Make parameters `required` where possible. Each optional parameter roughly doubles a portion of the grammar's state space. If a parameter always has a reasonable default, consider making it required and having Claude provide that default explicitly.
3. **Simplify nested structures.** Deeply nested objects with optional fields compound the complexity. Flatten structures where possible.
4. **Split into multiple requests.** If you have many strict tools, consider splitting them across separate requests or sub-agents.

For persistent issues with valid schemas, [contact support](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9015913-how-to-get-support) with your schema definition.

# Data retention

Prompts and responses are processed with ZDR when using structured outputs. However, the JSON schema itself is temporarily cached for up to 24 hours since last use for optimization purposes. No prompt or response data is retained beyond the API response.

Structured outputs are HIPAA eligible, but **PHI must not be included in JSON schema definitions**. The API compiles JSON schemas into grammars that are cached separately from message content, and these cached schemas do not receive the same PHI protections as prompts and responses. Do not include PHI in schema property names, `enum` values, `const` values, or `pattern` regular expressions. PHI should only appear in message content (prompts and responses), where it is protected under HIPAA safeguards.

For ZDR and HIPAA eligibility across all features, see [API and data retention](/docs/en/manage-claude/api-and-data-retention).

# Feature compatibility

**Works with:**

* **[Batch processing](/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing):** Process structured outputs at scale with 50% discount
* **[Token counting](/docs/en/build-with-claude/token-counting):** Count tokens without compilation
* **[Streaming](/docs/en/build-with-claude/streaming):** Stream structured outputs like normal responses
* **Combined usage:** Use JSON outputs (`output_config.format`) and strict tool use (`strict: true`) together in the same request

**Incompatible with:**

* **[Citations](/docs/en/build-with-claude/citations):** Citations require interleaving citation blocks with text, which conflicts with strict JSON schema constraints. Returns 400 error if citations enabled with `output_config.format`.
* **Message Prefilling:** Incompatible with JSON outputs

**Grammar scope:** Grammars apply only to Claude's direct output, not to tool use calls, tool results, or thinking tags (when using [Extended Thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking)). Grammar state resets between sections, allowing Claude to think freely while still producing structured output in the final response.
