Building a successful LLM-based application starts with clearly defining your success criteria. How will you know when your application is good enough to publish?

Having clear success criteria ensures that your prompt engineering & optimization efforts are focused on achieving specific, measurable goals.

# Building strong criteria

Good success criteria are:

* **Specific**: Clearly define what you want to achieve. Instead of "good performance," specify "accurate sentiment classification."
* **Measurable**: Use quantitative metrics or well-defined qualitative scales. Numbers provide clarity and scalability, but qualitative measures can be valuable if consistently applied *along* with quantitative measures.

  + Even "hazy" topics such as ethics and safety can be quantified:

    |  | Safety criteria |
    | --- | --- |
    | Bad | Safe outputs |
    | Good | Less than 0.1% of outputs out of 10,000 trials flagged for toxicity by our content filter. |

  ### Example metrics and measurement methods
* **Achievable**: Base your targets on industry benchmarks, prior experiments, AI research, or expert knowledge. Your success metrics should not be unrealistic to current frontier model capabilities.
* **Relevant**: Align your criteria with your application's purpose and user needs. Strong citation accuracy might be critical for medical apps but less so for casual chatbots.

# Common success criteria to consider

Here are some criteria that might be important for your use case. This list is non-exhaustive.

# Task fidelity

# Consistency

# Relevance and coherence

# Tone and style

# Privacy preservation

# Context utilization

# Latency

# Price

Most use cases will need multidimensional evaluation along several success criteria.
