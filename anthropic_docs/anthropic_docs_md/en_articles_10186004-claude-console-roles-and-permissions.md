**Source:** https://support.claude.com/en/articles/10186004-claude-console-roles-and-permissions

The Claude Console uses a role-based access system with five distinct roles: User, Claude Code User, Developer, Billing, and Admin. Each role has specific permissions and capabilities designed to help teams manage their API access securely.

# Role Types and Permissions

* Cannot view API keys, usage logs, or billing details.

# Developer

# Billing

* Can view usage and cost data

# Admin

# Workspace-Level Permissions

* Organization Admins automatically receive Workspace Admin permissions in all Workspaces.
* Organization Billing role holders can view cost, usage, and limit values across all Workspaces.
* Organization-level roles serve as a baseline, while Workspace roles can grant additional permissions.

  + For example, a User at the organization level can be granted Admin permissions within specific Workspaces

# Important Notes

* Removing an Admin or Billing role does not automatically update the billing email in our payment processor.
* To modify the primary billing email address or add additional billing contact emails, please [contact our Support Team](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9015913-how-to-get-support).
