# Stop Work

POST/v1/environments/{environment\_id}/work/{work\_id}/stop

Note: these endpoints are called automatically by the pre-built environment worker provided in the SDKs and CLI, for orchestrating sessions with self-hosted sandbox environments. They are included here as a reference; you do not need to invoke them directly.

Stop a work item, initiating graceful or forced shutdown.

data: [BetaSessionWorkData](/docs/en/api/beta#beta_session_work_data) { id, type }

The actual work to be performed

id: string

Session identifier (e.g., 'session\_...')

type: "session"

Type of work data

environment\_id: string

Environment identifier this work belongs to (e.g., `env_...`)

latest\_heartbeat\_at: string

RFC 3339 timestamp of the most recent heartbeat

metadata: map[string]

User-provided metadata key-value pairs associated with this work item

started\_at: string

RFC 3339 timestamp when work execution started

state: "queued" or "starting" or "active" or 2 more
