# Microsoft 365 Connector: Security Guide

**Source:** https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12684923-microsoft-365-connector-security-guide

# What It Is

The Microsoft 365 Connector is an **Anthropic-hosted integration** that enables Claude to securely access Microsoft 365 services (Outlook, SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams) through user-delegated permissions. Anthropic has completed Microsoft's publisher verification process, associating our verified Microsoft Partner Network account with this application to confirm our organizational identity.

The connector operates as a **secure proxy**, and your Microsoft 365 documents, emails, and files remain in your tenant. The connector only retrieves data on-demand during active queries and does not cache file content. Credentials are encrypted and managed by Anthropic's backend infrastructure. The MCP server itself does not store or manage these credentials. Microsoft's Azure SDK handles the On-Behalf-Of token exchange and caching on a per-user basis for accessing the Graph API.

# Access Restriction

# Access Can Be Fully Restricted

The connector provides **multiple layers of access control** to address your security requirements. For detailed information on administration of the Microsoft 365 Connector see [Enabling and Using the Microsoft 365 Connector](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12542951-enabling-and-using-the-microsoft-365-connector).

**1. Organization-Level Gating**

Access to the connector for Team and Enterprise plan users requires a two-step approval process. First, Owners must explicitly enable the Microsoft 365 connector in Claude Admin Settings by navigating to Admin Settings → Connectors → Browse connectors → Add "Microsoft 365". Until this approval is granted, users have no access.

Second, after the Owner enables the connector, a Microsoft Entra Global Administrator must complete individual authentication and grant consent on behalf of the whole organization before any team members can connect.

**2. Microsoft Entra Admin Pre-Consent Requirement**

Before users can access the connector, a Microsoft Entra Admin must complete a one-time setup, which will:

* Add two service principals and Enterprise apps in Microsoft Entra ID (M365 MCP Client and M365 MCP Server). This establishes a service-level identity for the Microsoft 365 Connector apps in your tenant
* Grant admin pre-consent for your Microsoft 365 tenant
* Optionally restrict which Microsoft Entra ID users and groups are allowed to use the connector
* Optionally restrict permissions the connector is allowed to use to selectively control which Microsoft 365 services are accessible

**3. Granular Permission Revocation**

You can selectively disable specific capabilities via Microsoft Entra Admin Center. For example:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **To Restrict** | **Action** | **Effect** |
| All access | Disable connector in Claude Admin Settings | Complete shutdown |
| SharePoint only | Revoke Sites.Read.All permission in Entra | Blocks SharePoint |
| Email access | Revoke Mail.Read permission in Entra | Blocks Outlook |
| Teams chat | Revoke Chat.Read permission in Entra | Blocks Teams |
| OneDrive files | Revoke Files.Read and/or Files.Read.All | Blocks reading files from OneDrive |

Changes take effect immediately for all users in your organization. Note that users can also choose to disable capabilities that they have permission to use during a chat or session by selectively toggling off the connector’s tools.

**4. Microsoft Conditional Access Integration**

The connector fully supports your existing Entra (Azure AD) policies:

* **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**: Enforce MFA for connector access
* **Device compliance**: Require managed/compliant devices
* **IP restrictions**: Limit Microsoft authentication to corporate network or VPN
* **Group-based access**: Restrict to specific security groups

**5. User-Level Permissions**

* The Microsoft 365 Connector uses [delegated permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview?tabs=http#delegated-permissions).
* Users can only access Microsoft 365 data **they already have permission** for
* SharePoint search requires Sites.Read.All permission. Site-specific permissioning (using \*.Selected permissions) is not supported because the underlying search is tenant-wide.
* Users cannot bypass SharePoint sharing settings or folder permissions
* Users cannot access other users' private files or emails
* Delegated permissions inherently respect Microsoft 365 data loss prevention (DLP) policies

**6. Token Management**

* Refresh tokens expire after 90 days of inactivity by default, requiring re-authentication. This can be customized in Microsoft Entra ID using a token lifetime policy.
* Access tokens typically expire within 60-90 minutes per Microsoft Entra ID defaults and are automatically refreshed
* Admins or users can revoke access anytime via Microsoft Entra ID
* The Microsoft 365 Connector never sees or stores passwords

# Security Architecture Summary

# Authentication Flow

* **OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of (OBO):** Industry-standard delegated authentication
* **PKCE protection**: Public client uses Proof Key for Code Exchange to prevent authorization code interception
* **Two-stage token exchange**: User authenticates to obtain access token for MCP server, then MCP server exchanges it for Graph API access using OBO flow with confidential client credentials. In this flow, not even the user or their Claude client has access to the OBO tokens. Only the MCP server can access and use tokens with access to the user’s data via the Microsoft Graph API.
* **No credential storage**: Users never share Microsoft passwords with Anthropic
* **Encrypted token storage**: Access and refresh tokens are encrypted while cached by the Claude backend

# Data Flow

* Documents and other content are retrieved **only during active queries**
* **Tool call results** from the connector that are **part of stored chats are retained**
* **The user who requested the Claude chat** can see the tool call results and Claude’s response incorporating the data
* **Other users shared on the chat** can only see Claude’s response incorporating the result of the tool call
* Each request creates a fresh data flow which is cleaned up after the response is returned

# Multi-Tenant Isolation

* Microsoft Entra tenants are **cryptographically separated** from each other using a common-scoped multi-tenant configuration
* Multi-tenant isolation is cryptographically enforced through digitally signed access tokens that bind each user to their organization’s tenant

# FAQs

# Q: Can we test with a small pilot group before enterprise-wide rollout?

A: Yes. The recommended approach is to use app assignment to restrict who can use the connector:

* Owner enables connector in Claude Admin Settings
* Microsoft Entra Admin completes pre-consent setup
* Use Microsoft Entra Enterprise App assignment to restrict access to specific users or groups (e.g., assign only "IT Security Test Group" to the app).
* Expand groups progressively for gradual deployment

# Q: How do we ensure no data leakage occurs between our organization and others in the multi-tenant environment?

**A**: Multi-tenant isolation ensures complete separation:

* Server uses the common tenant configuration to accept tokens from any Microsoft Entra ID tenant
* Each user's token contains their organization's tenant ID (tid claim) which is validated
* Graph API tokens obtained through OBO are automatically scoped to the user and their tenant
* Cross-tenant token access is prevented cryptographically by the design of Microsoft Graph’s OAuth 2.0 implementation.

# Q: What happens if an employee tries to access company data from a personal Claude account?

**A**: The connector validates identity during authentication:

* User must have access to the Team/Enterprise organization where the connector is enabled
* Microsoft login validates user's Microsoft Entra ID credentials
* Token validation confirms user's tenant ID
* Graph API enforces tenant boundaries
* Personal Claude accounts cannot access enterprise Microsoft 365 data without organization membership

# Q: Do you have audit logging for compliance?

**A:** Yes, audit logging is available for your compliance needs. All Graph API calls made by the connector are logged in your organization's Microsoft 365 audit log, which you can access through the M365 Compliance Center. These logs show the timestamp, user, operation performed, and resource accessed, with retention periods matching your Microsoft 365 audit policy. Additionally, Anthropic logs authentication and tool execution events.

# Q: Can we revoke access if we discover unauthorized usage?

**A**: There are multiple revocation methods:

* **User-level**: Users disconnect via Claude Settings → Connectors
* **Admin-level**: Disable connector in Claude Admin Settings (all users affected)
* **Permission-level**: Revoke specific permissions in Microsoft Entra Admin Center
* **Tenant-level**: Revoke all permissions in Microsoft Entra Admin Center

# Q: What certifications does Anthropic have?

**A:** Anthropic has the following certifications:

* **SOC 2 Type II** (annual audit)
* **ISO 27001** certified
* **GDPR compliant** (DPA available)
* **Microsoft publisher-verified** application
