After defining your success criteria, the next step is designing evaluations to measure LLM performance against those criteria. This is a vital part of the prompt engineering cycle.

This guide focuses on how to develop your test cases.

# Building evals and test cases

# Eval design principles

1. **Be task-specific**: Design evals that mirror your real-world task distribution. Don't forget to factor in edge cases!

   ### Example edge cases
2. **Automate when possible**: Structure questions to allow for automated grading (e.g., multiple-choice, string match, code-graded, LLM-graded).
3. **Prioritize volume over quality**: More questions with slightly lower signal automated grading is better than fewer questions with high-quality human hand-graded evals.

# Example evals

# Task fidelity (sentiment analysis) - exact match evaluation

# Consistency (FAQ bot) - cosine similarity evaluation

# Relevance and coherence (summarization) - ROUGE-L evaluation

# Tone and style (customer service) - LLM-based Likert scale

# Privacy preservation (medical chatbot) - LLM-based binary classification

# Context utilization (conversation assistant) - LLM-based ordinal scale

Writing hundreds of test cases can be hard to do by hand! Get Claude to help you generate more from a baseline set of example test cases.

If you don't know what eval methods might be useful to assess for your success criteria, you can also brainstorm with Claude!

# Grading evals

When deciding which method to use to grade evals, choose the fastest, most reliable, most scalable method:

1. **Code-based grading**: Fastest and most reliable, extremely scalable, but also lacks nuance for more complex judgements that require less rule-based rigidity.

   * Exact match: `output == golden_answer`
   * String match: `key_phrase in output`
2. **Human grading**: Most flexible and high quality, but slow and expensive. Avoid if possible.
3. **LLM-based grading**: Fast and flexible, scalable and suitable for complex judgement. Test to ensure reliability first then scale.

# Tips for LLM-based grading

* **Have detailed, clear rubrics**: "The answer should always mention 'Acme Inc.' in the first sentence. If it does not, the answer is automatically graded as 'incorrect.'"

  A given use case, or even a specific success criteria for that use case, might require several rubrics for holistic evaluation.
* **Empirical or specific**: For example, instruct the LLM to output only 'correct' or 'incorrect', or to judge from a scale of 1-5. Purely qualitative evaluations are hard to assess quickly and at scale.
* **Encourage reasoning**: Ask the LLM to think first before deciding an evaluation score, and then discard the reasoning. This increases evaluation performance, particularly for tasks requiring complex judgement.
