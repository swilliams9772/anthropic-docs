# Building Desktop Extensions with MCPB

**Source:** https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12922929-building-desktop-extensions-with-mcpb

This guide will help you build an MCP Bundle (.mcpb) to create a desktop extension for internal use, private distribution, or as a foundation for submission to [Anthropic’s Connectors Directory](https://claude.ai/directory).

# 1. Introduction

# What is an MCPB?

MCPB (.mcpb) files are zip archives containing a local MCP server and manifest.json. They enable single-click installation in Claude Desktop, similar to browser extensions.

**Key characteristics:**

* Runs locally on user's machine
* Communicates via stdio transport
* Bundles all dependencies
* Works offline
* No OAuth required

# When should I use a local server (MCPB) vs a remote server?

Choose a local server (MCPB) for:

**Internal Systems and Security**

* Access systems behind your firewall (JIRA, Confluence, internal wikis, private databases)
* Seamless authentication - Uses existing SSO and browser sessions automatically, no token management
* Zero-trust compliance - Operates within your corporate network boundaries without exposing internal resources publicly

**Local Resources**

* Direct filesystem access for code editing and Git operations
* Integration with locally installed tools (Docker, IDEs, databases)
* Hardware integration and desktop application control
* Privacy-sensitive operations that shouldn't leave the user's machine

**Enterprise Deployment**

* One-click installation with built-in Node.js runtime (no dependencies to manage)
* No cloud infrastructure, VPN configurations, or firewall rules required
* Organization-level controls - Admins can upload custom extensions and manage access via allowlists
* Complete control over authentication, authorization, and audit logs
  ​

Choose a remote connector for:

* Cloud services and public APIs requiring centralized infrastructure
* Distribution across claude on web, mobile and desktop
* Services needing centralized updates across all users
* OAuth flows requiring server-side token management
* Public-facing integrations used by multiple organizations

**Key difference:** MCPBs run on the user's machine via stdio transport with access to local and internal resources. Remote connectors run on your servers via HTTPS and are accessed through Anthropic's infrastructure.

**Real-world use:** Organizations are building MCPBs as secure proxies to internal MCP servers, for internal documentation access, and to connect development tools while maintaining their security architecture.

**For remote connector guidance:** See [MCP Partner FAQ](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11596036-anthropic-connectors-directory-faq) for complete remote connector documentation.

# 2. Getting Started

# Which programming language should I use?

**Node.js is strongly recommended** because:

* Ships with Claude for macOS and Windows (zero installation friction for users)
* Users don't need separate runtime installation
* Best compatibility and reliability with Claude Desktop
* Extensive MCP SDK support

---

# What platforms should I support?

Claude Desktop runs on:

* **macOS** (darwin)
* **Windows** (win32)

Specify supported platforms in your manifest.json compatibility section.

**Best practice:** Test on both platforms even if you primarily develop on one.

**Platform compatibility details:** See [MCPB Manifest Spec - Compatibility](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb/blob/main/MANIFEST.md#compatibility) for platform specification and runtime requirements.

---

# How do I create my first MCPB?

Follow this five-step process:

1. Install MCPB CLI: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/mcpb`

2. Create your MCP server (see MCP SDK)

3. Run mcpb init to create manifest.json

4. Run mcpb pack to bundle

5. Install and test in Claude Desktop

**For detailed implementation guidance:**

* [MCPB Repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) - Complete getting started guide, CLI usage, and specifications
* [MCPB Examples](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb/tree/main/examples) - Working reference implementations including "Hello World"
* [MCP SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/sdk) - Core protocol implementation

**For comprehensive guidance on development, testing, and best practices,** see the [MCPB README's "For Bundle Developers" section](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb/blob/main/README.md).

**Important:** Before distributing your MCPB, review the testing and best practices guidance in the MCPB README to ensure quality.

# 3. Configuration

# What is manifest.json?

The manifest.json file is required metadata that describes your MCPB - what it does, how to run it, which tools it provides, and what configuration it needs.

For the most up to date information, refer to the official MCPB Specification.

* [MCPB Manifest Spec](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb/blob/main/MANIFEST.md) - Full schema with all fields
* [Example Manifests](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb/tree/main/examples) - Real-world implementations
* [CLI Documentation](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb/blob/main/CLI.md) - Command reference

# How do I add an icon?

Icons are optional but recommended for professional appearance.

**Basic approach:** Include icon.png file in your bundle root directory and reference it in manifest.json.

**Requirements:**

* **File name:** icon.png (or custom path)
* **Size:** 512×512px recommended (minimum 256×256px)
* **Format:** PNG with transparency support
* **Location:** Bundle root or specified path

**Advanced options:** Multiple icon variants for different sizes and themes (light/dark mode support).

**Implementation details:** See [MCPB Manifest Spec - Icons](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb/blob/main/MANIFEST.md#icons) for:

* Icon field configuration
* Multiple icon variants syntax
* Size and theme specifications
* Best practices and requirements

---

# How do users configure my MCPB?

Define user\_config section in manifest.json. Claude Desktop automatically creates a settings UI where users can configure your extension.

See [MCPB Manifest Spec - User Configuration](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb/blob/main/MANIFEST.md#user-configuration) for the complete implementation:

* Full schema and examples
* All configuration types and properties
* Validation constraints
* Sensitive data handling
* Multi-select patterns

---

# How do users install my MCPB?

There are three different installation methods:

1. **Double-click** - Download .mcpb file and double-click to open
2. **Drag-and-drop** - Drag .mcpb file into Claude Desktop window
3. **File menu** - Developer → Extensions → Install Extension → select .mcpb file

**All methods open installation UI** where users can:

* Review extension details and permissions
* Configure required settings
* Grant necessary permissions
* Complete installation

**Installation scope:** Per-user installation - each user must install separately on their own system.

**User experience and admin controls:** For detailed information about the end-user installation experience and enterprise admin controls (including Team/Enterprise organization management and policy configuration), see:
