While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).

When faced with complex tasks like research, analysis, or problem-solving, giving Claude space to think can dramatically improve its performance. This technique, known as chain of thought (CoT) prompting, encourages Claude to break down problems step-by-step, leading to more accurate and nuanced outputs.

# Before implementing CoT

# Why let Claude think?

* **Accuracy:** Stepping through problems reduces errors, especially in math, logic, analysis, or generally complex tasks.
* **Coherence:** Structured thinking leads to more cohesive, well-organized responses.
* **Debugging:** Seeing Claude's thought process helps you pinpoint where prompts may be unclear.

# Why not let Claude think?

* Increased output length may impact latency.
* Not all tasks require in-depth thinking. Use CoT judiciously to ensure the right balance of performance and latency.

Use CoT for tasks that a human would need to think through, like complex math, multi-step analysis, writing complex documents, or decisions with many factors.

# How to prompt for thinking

The chain of thought techniques below are **ordered from least to most complex**. Less complex methods take up less space in the context window, but are also generally less powerful.

**CoT tip**: Always have Claude output its thinking. Without outputting its thought process, no thinking occurs!

* **Basic prompt**: Include "Think step-by-step" in your prompt.
  + Lacks guidance on *how* to think (which is especially not ideal if a task is very specific to your app, use case, or organization)

  ### Example: Writing donor emails (basic CoT)
* **Guided prompt**: Outline specific steps for Claude to follow in its thinking process.
  + Lacks structuring to make it easy to strip out and separate the answer from the thinking.

  ### Example: Writing donor emails (guided CoT)
* **Structured prompt**: Use XML tags like `<thinking>` and `<answer>` to separate reasoning from the final answer.

  ### Example: Writing donor emails (structured guided CoT)

# Example: Financial analysis without thinking
