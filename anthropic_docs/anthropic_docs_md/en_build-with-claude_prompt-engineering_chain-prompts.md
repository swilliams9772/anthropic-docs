While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).

When working with complex tasks, Claude can sometimes drop the ball if you try to handle everything in a single prompt. Chain of thought (CoT) prompting is great, but what if your task has multiple distinct steps that each require in-depth thought?

Enter prompt chaining: breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.

# Why chain prompts?

1. **Accuracy**: Each subtask gets Claude's full attention, reducing errors.
2. **Clarity**: Simpler subtasks mean clearer instructions and outputs.
3. **Traceability**: Easily pinpoint and fix issues in your prompt chain.

# When to chain prompts

Use prompt chaining for multi-step tasks like research synthesis, document analysis, or iterative content creation. When a task involves multiple transformations, citations, or instructions, chaining prevents Claude from dropping or mishandling steps.

**Remember:** Each link in the chain gets Claude's full attention!

**Debugging tip**: If Claude misses a step or performs poorly, isolate that step in its own prompt. This lets you fine-tune problematic steps without redoing the entire task.

# How to chain prompts

1. **Identify subtasks**: Break your task into distinct, sequential steps.
2. **Structure with XML for clear handoffs**: Use XML tags to pass outputs between prompts.
3. **Have a single-task goal**: Each subtask should have a single, clear objective.
4. **Iterate**: Refine subtasks based on Claude's performance.

# Example chained workflows:

* **Multi-step analysis**: See the legal and business examples below.
* **Content creation pipelines**: Research → Outline → Draft → Edit → Format.
* **Data processing**: Extract → Transform → Analyze → Visualize.
* **Decision-making**: Gather info → List options → Analyze each → Recommend.
* **Verification loops**: Generate content → Review → Refine → Re-review.

**Optimization tip**: For tasks with independent subtasks (like analyzing multiple docs), create separate prompts and run them in parallel for speed.

# Advanced: Self-correction chains

You can chain prompts to have Claude review its own work! This catches errors and refines outputs, especially for high-stakes tasks.
