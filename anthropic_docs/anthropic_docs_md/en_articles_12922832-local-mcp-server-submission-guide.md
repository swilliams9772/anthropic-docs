# Local MCP Server Submission Guide

**Source:** https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12922832-local-mcp-server-submission-guide

This is a complete guide for submitting your local server (MCPB) to Anthropic's public directory for broader distribution and discoverability.

# Prerequisites

**Before reading this guide, you should have:**

* A working MCPB
* Portable code using variable substitution
* Good error messages and user experience
* Clean, bundled dependencies

**New to MCPB development?** See [Building MCPB Extensions](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12922929-building-desktop-extensions-with-mcpb) first. For technical best practices (testing, error messages, portability), see [MCPB Repository](https://github.com/anthropics/mcpb).

**Note:** This guide covers local MCP servers. For remote desktop extensions, see [Remote MCP Server Submission Guide](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12922490-remote-mcp-server-submission-guide).

# 1. Directory Overview

# What are the benefits of directory inclusion?

**Discoverability and trust:**

* Listed in official Anthropic directory within Claude Desktop
* Searchable by individual Claude Desktop users
* Visible to Teams/Enterprise users when added to allowlist by admins
* Anthropic review builds user trust

**User experience:**

* One-click installation from directory
* Integrated with Claude Desktop settings UI
* Standardized presentation

**Support and credibility:**

* Anthropic review of quality and security
* Listed alongside other reviewed extensions
* Community visibility and feedback
* Professional distribution channel

---

# 2. Mandatory Requirements

**All requirements in this section are mandatory for directory approval.** Missing any of these will result in rejection or a revision request.

**Note:** These are Anthropic directory-specific requirements.

For general MCPB development best practices (testing, error handling, portability), see the [MCPB Repository README](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb/blob/main/README.md).

---

# Are tool annotations required?

YES. Every tool MUST have and maintain accurate safety annotations.

**Required on every tool:**

* readOnlyHint: true - For tools that only read data
* destructiveHint: true - For tools that modify data or have side effects

See [MCP Protocol - Tool Annotations](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/legacy/concepts/tools) for complete schema and implementation details.

**Not optional.** This is a hard requirement derived from the [MCP Directory Policy](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11697096-anthropic-mcp-directory-policy).

**How to decide which annotation:**

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tool Behavior** | **Annotation** | **Examples** |
| Only reads data | readOnlyHint: true | search, get, list, fetch, read |
| Writes/modifies data | destructiveHint: true | create, update, delete, send, write |
| Creates temp files | destructiveHint: true | Even temporary writes count |
| Sends external requests | destructiveHint: true | Emails, notifications, webhooks |
| Caches internally only | readOnlyHint: true | Internal optimization OK |

**Implementation details:** See [MCP Protocol - Tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools) for:

* Complete tool schema with annotations
* Tool definition structure
* Input/output schema specifications
* Additional tool properties (including optional title field)

**Validation before submission:**

# Check all tools have annotations

grep -A 5 -B 5 "readOnlyHint\|destructiveHint" server/

# Verify each tool has exactly one annotation

**Impact:** The first thing we check and the most common reason for a revision request.

**Additional recommended annotation:**

* title - Human-readable tool name for UI display (improves user experience)

---

# Are privacy policies required?

Yes, privacy policies are required in two locations:

**Location 1: README.md**

Add a "Privacy Policy" section to your README with link to your full privacy policy so that users are aware of your practices:

```
# Privacy Policy

This extension collects [describe data types]. For complete privacy information, see our privacy policy: https://your-domain.com/privacy-policy

# Data Collection
- [List what data is collected]
- [How it's used]
- [Whether it's shared with third parties]
- [Retention period]
```

**Location 2: manifest.json**

Add `privacy_policies` array with publicly accessible HTTPS URLs:

**Complete implementation:** See [MCPB Manifest Spec - Privacy Policies](https://github.com/anthropics/mcpb/blob/main/MANIFEST.md) for:

* Privacy policy field structure
* Manifest version requirements (0.3+)
* Multiple policy URL support
* Validation requirements

**Privacy policy must cover:**

* What data your MCPB collects
* How data is used and stored
* Whether data is shared with third parties
* User data retention policies
* Contact information for privacy questions

**Requirements:**

* Must be publicly accessible HTTPS URL
* Must be from your domain (not third-party hosting)
* Must be current and accurate
* Must be in README **AND** manifest.json
* Must use manifest\_version "0.3" or higher

**Common mistakes:**

* Privacy policy in manifest but not README
* Privacy policy in README but not manifest
* Using manifest\_version "0.2" or older
* Invalid or inaccessible URLs
* Privacy policy hosted on third-party site

**Impact:** One of the most common causes of rejection - straightforward to fix but frequently overlooked.

# How many examples are required?

MINIMUM of three working examples demonstrating core functionality.

**What qualifies as a good example:**

* Shows realistic use case
* Includes expected user input/prompt
* Shows expected output/behavior
* Demonstrates actual tool usage
* Clear and understandable workflow

**Example format (in README.md):**

```
# Examples

# Example 1: Search for files
**User prompt:** "Find all JavaScript files in my project"

**Expected behavior:**
- Extension searches workspace directory
- Returns list of .js files with paths
- Shows file count in summary

# Example 2: Read file contents
**User prompt:** "Show me the contents of config.json"

**Expected behavior:**
- Extension reads config.json
- Returns formatted JSON content
- Handles file not found gracefully

# Example 3: Create new file
**User prompt:** "Create a new file called notes.txt with 'Hello World'"

**Expected behavior:**
- Extension creates notes.txt
- Writes content to file
- Confirms creation with file path
```

**What to include:**

* Realistic user prompts (how users will interact)
* Expected tool calls (what happens behind the scenes)
* Expected outputs (what users will see)
* Error handling examples (optional but recommended)

**Requirements:**

* Minimum 3 examples (no maximum)
* Cover core functionality
* Show different tools/capabilities
* Demonstrate value proposition
* Include in README.md

**Impact:** A frequent source of delays or rejections - reviewers need complete documentation to properly evaluate submissions.

---

# Do I need to provide testing credentials?

If your MCPB requires authentication or external service access, then YES.

**Required when:**

* Your MCPB connects to external APIs
* Authentication is needed for functionality
* The MCPB user must have an account to use features
* External service integration otherwise present

**Not required when:**

* Purely local MCPB (filesystem operations only)
* No external connections
* No authentication needed
* Completely self-contained

**What to provide:**

* Test account credentials (username/password or API keys)
* Sample data in account (helpful for functional testing)
* Setup instructions (how to configure and use test account)
* Access limitations or restrictions (if any)
* Account expiration date (if temporary)

**How to provide:**

* Include in submission form
* Send via secure method if highly sensitive
* Ensure account remains active throughout review period
* Provide sufficient access level for complete testing

**Best practice:** Create dedicated test account separate from production to:

* Avoid exposing production data
* Control what reviewers can access
* Easily revoke access after approval
* Track test account usage

**Impact:** Delays review process if missing when needed

# 4. Common Issues

# What are the most common reasons for revision requests?

These are the top issues based on submission data:

**1. Missing tool annotations**

* **Problem:** Tools missing required readOnlyHint or destructiveHint annotations
* **Fix:** Add annotations to ALL tools in your server implementation
* **Impact:** Immediate rejection, requires code changes
* **Prevention:** Run validation command before submission

**2. Portability issues**

* **Problem:** Works in developer environment but fails for end users
* **Common causes:** Hardcoded paths, missing dependencies, platform assumptions
* **Fix:** Test in clean environment, use variable substitution, bundle dependencies
* **Impact:** 1-2 week delay for troubleshooting and resubmission
* **Prevention:** Clean environment testing phase

**3. Missing privacy policy**

* **Problem:** Privacy policy missing from README.md or manifest.json (or both)
* **Fix:** Add privacy policy section to README and privacy\_policies array to manifest
* **Impact:** Immediate rejection
* **Prevention:** Use pre-submission checklist

**4. Incomplete documentation**

* **Problem:** Fewer than 3 examples, unclear setup instructions, missing sections
* **Fix:** Add comprehensive examples (minimum 3) and complete all required README sections
* **Impact:** Revision request, delays approval
* **Prevention:** Follow README structure template

**Note:** These issues account for 90% of revision requests based on submission data. All are preventable with thorough pre-submission testing and checklist completion.

# How can I avoid these issues?

Follow these prevention best practices:

**1. Complete the checklist**

* Follow entire pre-submission checklist item-by-item
* Don't skip clean environment testing
* Verify each requirement twice before submitting
* Get second person to review if possible

**2. Test like an end user**

* Use fresh virtual machine or container
* Install no development tools
* Follow only your README instructions
* Verify everything works without prior knowledge

**3. Validate tool annotations**

```
# Quick check - should show all your tools with annotations
grep -A 5 -B 5 "readOnlyHint\|destructiveHint" server/

# Verify each tool has exactly one annotation (not both, not neither)
# Count should match your total number of tools
```

**4. Privacy policy verification**

```
# Check README has privacy section
grep -i "privacy" README.md

# Check manifest has privacy_policies array
grep "privacy_policies" manifest.json

# Verify URLs are accessible
curl -I https://your-domain.com/privacy-policy
```

**5. Example quality self-assessment**

* Read your examples as if you're a completely new user
* Do they make sense without additional context?
* Do they show realistic, practical usage?
* Are there at least 3 distinct examples?
* Do they cover your core functionality?

**Success rate:** Extensions following this prevention guide have fewer revision requests.

---

# Can my MCPB be removed from the directory?

Yes. Removal can occur for various reasons.

**Voluntary removal (your choice):**

* Request removal anytime via contact form
* No penalties for voluntary removal
* Can resubmit later after improvements
* Useful if major rework needed

**Removal by Anthropic:**

Anthropic may remove extensions from the directory at any time and for any reason, at its sole discretion.

**Recommendations to avoid removal:**

* Maintain quality standards consistently
* Respond to issues promptly (within days, not weeks)
* Keep dependencies updated quarterly
* Monitor user feedback actively
* Maintain compliance with evolving policies
* Set up monitoring for runtime errors

---

# 5. Directory Policy

# What policies must I comply with?

All extensions must comply with the [Anthropic MCP Directory Policy](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11697096-anthropic-mcp-directory-policy).
