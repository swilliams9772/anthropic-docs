# Using the Messages API

Anthropic offers two ways to build with Claude, each suited to different use cases:

|  | Messages API | Claude Managed Agents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **What it is** | Direct model prompting access | Pre-built, configurable agent harness that runs in managed infrastructure |
| **Best for** | Custom agent loops and fine-grained control | Long-running tasks and asynchronous work |
| **Learn more** | [Messages API docs](/docs/en/build-with-claude/working-with-messages) | [Claude Managed Agents docs](/docs/en/managed-agents/overview) |

This guide covers common patterns for working with the Messages API, including basic requests, multi-turn conversations, prefill techniques, and vision capabilities. For complete API specifications, see the [Messages API reference](/docs/en/api/messages/create).

This feature is eligible for [Zero Data Retention (ZDR)](/docs/en/build-with-claude/api-and-data-retention). When your organization has a ZDR arrangement, data sent through this feature is not stored after the API response is returned.

# Basic request and response

cURLCLIPythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby

```
message = anthropic.Anthropic().messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-7",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}],
)
print(message)
```

Output

```
{
  "id": "msg_01XFDUDYJgAACzvnptvVoYEL",
  "type": "message",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Hello!"
    }
  ],
  "model": "claude-opus-4-7",
  "stop_reason": "end_turn",
  "stop_sequence": null,
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 12,
    "output_tokens": 6
  }
}
```

# Multiple conversational turns

The Messages API is stateless, which means that you always send the full conversational history to the API. You can use this pattern to build up a conversation over time. Earlier conversational turns don't necessarily need to actually originate from Claude. You can use synthetic `assistant` messages.

cURLCLIPythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby

```
message = anthropic.Anthropic().messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-7",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Can you describe LLMs to me?"},
    ],
)
print(message)
```

Output

```
{
  "id": "msg_018gCsTGsXkYJVqYPxTgDHBU",
  "type": "message",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Sure, I'd be happy to provide..."
    }
  ],
  "model": "claude-opus-4-7",
  "stop_reason": "end_turn",
  "stop_sequence": null,
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 30,
    "output_tokens": 309
  }
}
```

# Putting words in Claude's mouth

You can pre-fill part of Claude's response in the last position of the input messages list. This can be used to shape Claude's response. The example below uses `"max_tokens": 1` to get a single multiple choice answer from Claude.

Prefilling is not supported on [Claude Mythos Preview](https://anthropic.com/glasswing), Claude Opus 4.7, Claude Opus 4.6, and Claude Sonnet 4.6. Requests using prefill with these models return a 400 error. Use [structured outputs](/docs/en/build-with-claude/structured-outputs) or system prompt instructions instead. See the [migration guide](/docs/en/about-claude/models/migration-guide) for migration patterns.

```
message = anthropic.Anthropic().messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    max_tokens=1,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What is latin for Ant? (A) Apoidea, (B) Rhopalocera, (C) Formicidae",
        },
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer is ("},
    ],
)
print(message)
```

Output

```

  "id": "msg_01Q8Faay6S7QPTvEUUQARt7h",
  "type": "message",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [
    {

    }

  "stop_sequence": null,
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 42,
    "output_tokens": 1
  }
}
```

# Vision

Claude can read both text and images in requests. Images can be supplied using the `base64`, `url`, or `file` source types. The `file` source type references an image uploaded through the [Files API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/files). Supported media types are `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, and `image/webp`. See the [vision guide](/docs/en/build-with-claude/vision) for more details.
