New to remote MCP development? See [Getting Started with Custom Connectors Using Remote MCP](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11175166-getting-started-with-custom-connectors-using-remote-mcp) first. For technical best practices and protocol details, see [MCP Protocol Documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

**Note:** This guide covers remote MCP servers (cloud-hosted, HTTPS). For local desktop extensions, see [Local MCP Server Submission Guide](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12922832-local-mcp-server-submission-guide).

# 2. Mandatory Requirements

All requirements in this section are **mandatory for directory approval**. Missing any of these will result in rejection or revision requests.

# Are safety annotations required?

YES - Every tool MUST have accurate safety annotations.

**Required on every tool:**

* readOnlyHint: true - For tools that only read data
* destructiveHint: true - For tools that modify data or have side effects

See [MCP Protocol - Tool Annotations](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/legacy/concepts/tools) for complete schema and implementation details.

**Not optional.** This is a hard requirement derived from the [MCP Directory Policy](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11697096-anthropic-mcp-directory-policy).

**How to decide which annotation:**

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tool Behavior** | **Annotation** | **Examples** |
| Only reads data | readOnlyHint: true, destructiveHint: false | search, get, list, fetch, read |
| Writes/modifies data | destructiveHint: true, readOnlyHint: false | create, update, delete, send |
| Creates temp files | destructiveHint: true | Even temporary writes count |
| Sends external requests | destructiveHint: true | Emails, notifications, webhooks |
| Caches internally only | readOnlyHint: true | Internal optimization OK |

**Additional recommended annotation:**

* title - Human-readable tool name for UI display (improves user experience)

# Do I need to provide test accounts?

YES - If your server requires authentication.

**What to provide:**

* Test account credentials (username/password or API keys)
* Sample data in account (necessary for functional testing)
* Setup instructions for test environment
* Access limitations (if any)

**Test accounts should have:**

* Access to all tools being reviewed
* Representative sample data
* Appropriate permissions for full functionality testing
* Active status throughout review period and beyond

**How to provide:**

* Include credentials in submission form (ideally shared via secure method, such as 1Password link)
* Ensure accounts remain active during and after review for periodic post-admission reviews
* Provide sufficient access for comprehensive testing

# Is OAuth 2.0 required?

YES - If your server requires authentication.

**OAuth implementation requirements:**

* Must use OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow
* Certificates from recognized authorities
* Allowlist local MCP client (e.g. Claude Code, MCP Inspector) callback URLs:

  + http://localhost:6274/oauth/callback
  + http://localhost:6274/oauth/callback/debug
* Allowlist Claude callback URLs:

  + <https://claude.ai/api/mcp/auth_callback>
  + <https://claude.com/api/mcp/auth_callback>
* Proper redirect URI configuration

**Common OAuth issues to avoid:**

* Invalid redirect URI errors (ensure both callback URLs are allowlisted)
* HEAD requests without tokens (handle gracefully after OAuth flow)

Implementation guidance: See [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/authorization) for complete OAuth implementation details.

# Are there firewall requirements?

**YES - Must allowlist Claude's IP addresses for claude.ai compatibility**

For servers behind firewalls, allowlist IP addresses from <https://docs.claude.com/en/api/ip-addresses>.

Required for: Claude.ai and Claude Desktop

Not required for: Claude Code (connects directly from user's machine)

**Important:** IP allowlisting alone is not recommended as a security measure. Use OAuth 2.0 for authentication whenever possible.

# What documentation is required?

Comprehensive server documentation with specific sections.

**Recommended sections:**

1. **Server Description** - Clear explanation of what your server does
2. **Features** - Key capabilities and use cases
3. **Setup Instructions** - How users connect and configure
4. **Authentication** - OAuth setup and requirements (if applicable)
5. **Usage Examples** - Minimum 3 working examples with prompts (required)
6. **Privacy Policy** - Link to full privacy policy
7. **Support** - How users can get help or report issues

**Example documentation structure:**

```

# 4. Common Issues

# What are the most common reasons for revision requests?

These are the top issues based on submission data:

**1. Missing tool annotations**

* **Problem:** Tools missing required safety annotations
* **Fix:** Add readOnlyHint or destructiveHint to ALL tools
* **Impact:** Immediate rejection, requires code changes
* **Prevention:** Validate all tools before submission

**2. OAuth implementation issues**

* **Problem:** OAuth flow fails or has configuration errors
* **Common causes:**

  + Missing callback URLs in OAuth provider
  + Invalid redirect URI configuration
  + Firewall misconfiguration
* **Fix:** Test OAuth flow thoroughly with MCP Inspector, Claude Code or Claude.ai
* **Impact:** Cannot complete functional testing, delays approval

**3. Incomplete documentation**

* **Problem:** Missing examples, unclear setup instructions, or missing required sections
* **Fix:** Provide minimum 3 detailed examples and complete all documentation sections
* **Impact:** Revision request, delays approval
* **Prevention:** Follow documentation template exactly

**4. Production readiness concerns**

* **Problem:** Server marked as "beta" or shows instability issues
* **Fix:** Ensure GA status and stable production deployment
* **Impact:** Cannot be included until production-ready
* **Prevention:** Complete internal testing and stability validation

**5. Privacy policy/support channel issues**

* **Problem:** Missing or inaccessible URLs for privacy policy/support channels
* **Fix:** Provide proper privacy policy and support channels (email or web)
* **Impact:** Immediate rejection due to policy requirement
* **Prevention:** Verify privacy policy/support channel accessibility before submission

# How can I avoid these issues?

Follow these prevention best practices:

**1. Complete the checklist thoroughly**

* Follow pre-submission checklist item by item
* Don't skip any requirements
* Get second-person review if possible
* Test from user perspective, not developer environment

**2. Test OAuth implementation extensively**

* Test with MCP Inspector, Claude Code or Claude.ai
* Verify all callback URLs work
* Test authentication flow end-to-end
* Ensure proper token handling

**3. Validate tool annotations**

* Verify every tool has safety annotations
* Check that annotations match actual tool behavior
* Ensure consistency across all tools

**4. Test server connectivity**

* Verify server accessible from intended IP ranges
* Test CORS configuration with browser clients
* Confirm HTTPS certificate validity
* Check firewall rules if applicable

**5. Document comprehensively**

* Include minimum 3 detailed examples
* Cover all setup and configuration steps
* Provide clear troubleshooting guidance
* Test documentation with new users

**Success rate:** Servers following this prevention guide have significantly fewer revision requests and faster approval times.

# 5. Directory Policy

# What policies must I comply with?

All servers must comply with the [Anthropic MCP Directory Policy](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11697096-anthropic-mcp-directory-policy).

# Can my server be removed from the directory?

Yes. Removal can occur for various reasons.

**Voluntary removal:**

* Request removal anytime through support channels
* No penalties for voluntary removal
* Can resubmit later after improvements
* Useful for major rework or updates

**Removal by Anthropic:**

Anthropic may remove extensions from the directory at any time and for any reason, at its sole discretion.

**Recommendations to avoid removal:**

* Monitor server performance and uptime
* Respond promptly to user issues and support requests
* Keep dependencies updated and secure
* Maintain compliance with evolving policies
* Set up monitoring and alerting for server health
