Azure workloads authenticate to the Claude API by presenting a JSON Web Token (JWT) issued by Microsoft Entra ID, then exchanging it for a short-lived Anthropic access token. There are two common ways to obtain the Entra-issued token:

* **Managed identity (VMs, App Service, Functions, Container Apps):** The workload calls the Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) at `http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token` and receives a JWT for its assigned identity.
* **Entra Workload Identity (AKS pods):** Kubernetes projects a service account token (signed by the AKS cluster's OIDC issuer) into the pod at the path in `AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE`. The workload exchanges that token at Entra for an Entra-issued access token.

In both cases the Entra-issued token you present to Anthropic carries a tenant-specific Entra issuer (the [Configure Anthropic](#configure-anthropic) step below shows the exact URL to register) and the managed identity's object ID in the `sub` and `oid` claims. You register that issuer with Anthropic once, write a federation rule that matches the expected claims, and your workload exchanges its Entra token for an `sk-ant-oat01-...` access token at runtime.

AKS pods can alternatively skip the Entra exchange and present the Kubernetes-projected service account token to Anthropic directly. That path registers your AKS cluster's OIDC issuer with Anthropic instead of your Entra tenant. See [Kubernetes](/docs/en/manage-claude/wif-providers/kubernetes) for that flow.

# Prerequisites

* Familiarity with [WIF concepts](/docs/en/manage-claude/workload-identity-federation#concepts): service accounts, federation issuers, and federation rules.
* An Azure subscription with permission to assign managed identities (or configure Entra Workload Identity on AKS).
* Your Microsoft Entra tenant ID. Find it in the Azure portal under **Microsoft Entra ID → Overview → Tenant ID**.
* Permission to create service accounts, federation issuers, and federation rules in the Claude Console for your Anthropic organization.

# Configure Azure

Set up the identity that Azure will issue tokens for. Choose the path that matches where your workload runs.

Entra Workload Identity (AKS)

Entra Workload Identity (AKS)

Enable a system-assigned or user-assigned managed identity on your Azure resource. In the Azure portal, open the resource, go to **Identity**, and turn on **System assigned** (or attach a user-assigned identity).

After the identity is created, note its **Object (principal) ID**. This GUID appears as both the `sub` and `oid` claims in the issued token, and your Anthropic federation rule will match on it. You can find it on the resource's **Identity** page, or under **Microsoft Entra ID → Enterprise applications** for user-assigned identities.

No further Azure-side configuration is required. The Azure Instance Metadata Service is reachable at `169.254.169.254` from inside the resource once the identity is attached.

# Token claims

An Entra-issued token for a managed identity carries these claims:

```
{
  "iss": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT_ID>/v2.0",
  "sub": "9f8e7d6c-1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-...",
  "aud": "https://api.anthropic.com",
  "oid": "9f8e7d6c-1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-...",
  "tid": "<TENANT_ID>",
  "azp": "<CLIENT_ID>",
  "exp": 1775527120
}
```

`sub` and `oid` are identical (the managed identity's object ID). `azp` is the application or client ID. Match on `oid` to authorize one specific identity, or on `azp` to authorize any identity associated with an application registration. The `tid` claim repeats your tenant ID; matching on it is defense in depth, because the issuer URL already pins the tenant.

# Configure Anthropic

Follow the [setup walkthrough](/docs/en/manage-claude/workload-identity-federation#set-up-federation) to register a federation issuer, create an Anthropic service account, and create a federation rule in the Claude Console. In the Console, choose the **OIDC** provider option and supply the Entra-specific values that follow.

**Federation issuer:** Entra publishes an OIDC discovery document at the per-tenant issuer URL, so use discovery mode. Each Azure tenant you federate needs its own issuer record.

```
{
  "name": "azure-prod-tenant",
  "issuer_url": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT_ID>/v2.0",
  "jwks_source": "discovery"
}
```

Depending on the token version, the `iss` claim may be `https://sts.windows.net/<TENANT_ID>/` instead. Decode your managed-identity token (the Verify section below shows how) and register whichever `iss` value it contains. The two URLs share the same JWKS, so discovery mode works for either.

**Federation rule:** Match on the managed identity's object ID and your tenant ID.

```
{
  "name": "azure-inference-worker",
  "issuer_id": "fdis_...",
  "match": {
    "audience": "https://api.anthropic.com",
    "claims": {
      "oid": "9f8e7d6c-1a2b-3c4d-5e6f-...",
      "tid": "<TENANT_ID>"
    }
  },
  "target": {
    "type": "service_account",
    "service_account_id": "svac_..."
  },
  "workspace_id": "wrkspc_...",
  "oauth_scope": "workspace:developer",
  "token_lifetime_seconds": 600
}
```

# Acquire and use the token

At runtime your workload fetches its Entra token, exchanges it at `POST /v1/oauth/token`, and uses the returned bearer token to call Claude. Each Anthropic SDK handles the exchange and refresh loop when you supply a token-provider callable, as shown in the following examples. The cURL tab shows the raw flow.

import os

def fetch_entra_token() -> str:
    """Fetch a managed identity token from Azure IMDS."""
    response = requests.get(

    return response.json()["access_token"]

        workspace_id=os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_WORKSPACE_ID"),

# On AKS with Entra Workload Identity

On AKS, the file at `AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE` is a Kubernetes-projected service account token signed by your cluster's OIDC issuer, not an Entra-issued token. To stay on the Entra-mediated path described on this page, exchange that token at `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT_ID>/oauth2/v2.0/token` (federated `client_credentials` grant) first, then pass the resulting Entra access token to the Anthropic SDK as the identity token.

cURLPythonTypeScriptGoJavaC#PHPRubyCLI

```
import os
from pathlib import Path
import httpx
import anthropic
from anthropic import WorkloadIdentityCredentials

def fetch_entra_token_via_federation() -> str:
    federated_token = Path(os.environ["AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE"]).read_text()
    response = httpx.post(

            "client_assertion": federated_token,
        },
    )
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()["access_token"]

client = anthropic.Anthropic(
    credentials=WorkloadIdentityCredentials(
        identity_token_provider=fetch_entra_token_via_federation,
        federation_rule_id=os.environ["ANTHROPIC_FEDERATION_RULE_ID"],
        organization_id=os.environ["ANTHROPIC_ORGANIZATION_ID"],
        service_account_id=os.environ["ANTHROPIC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID"],
        workspace_id=os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_WORKSPACE_ID"),
    ),
)

message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello from Azure"}],
)
print(message.content[0].text)
```

Alternatively, register your AKS cluster's OIDC issuer with Anthropic directly and skip the Entra hop. See [Kubernetes](/docs/en/manage-claude/wif-providers/kubernetes) for that pattern.

# Verify the setup

From your Azure resource, run the cURL exchange shown earlier and confirm that `POST /v1/oauth/token` returns a `200` with an `access_token` beginning with `sk-ant-oat01-` and an `expires_in` value in seconds. On `400 invalid_grant`, see [Troubleshoot a failed exchange](/docs/en/manage-claude/wif-reference#troubleshoot-a-failed-exchange); the most common Azure-side cause is a mismatch between the `issuer_url` you registered and the `iss` claim in your decoded token. They must match exactly. For managed-identity tokens the `iss` value is either `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT_ID>/v2.0` or `https://sts.windows.net/<TENANT_ID>/`.

# Scope your rule

The `oid` claim is a managed identity's GUID and has no stable prefix. A
`subject_prefix` with `*` matches arbitrary identities in the tenant, so any
workload that holds a managed identity could obtain a federated Anthropic
token.

Lock the rule's `match` block to the narrowest scope that fits your use case:

* **Match `oid` as an exact value:** Set `claims.oid` to the managed identity's full object ID and never use `subject_prefix` for Azure tokens.
* **Pin `tid` as defense in depth:** The issuer URL already pins your tenant, but adding `claims.tid` guards against configuration drift if the issuer record is later edited.
* **Pin the audience:** Set `audience` to `https://api.anthropic.com` so tokens minted for other resources are rejected.
* **Use a separate rule per managed identity:** Create one rule per identity rather than one rule that authorizes several, so you can revoke a single workload's access without affecting others.

# Next steps

* Review the full configuration model in [Workload Identity Federation](/docs/en/manage-claude/workload-identity-federation).
* See the [provider guides](/docs/en/manage-claude/workload-identity-federation#identity-providers) for AWS, Google Cloud, GitHub Actions, and Kubernetes.
* For environment variables, profile files, and credential precedence, see the [WIF reference](/docs/en/manage-claude/wif-reference).
