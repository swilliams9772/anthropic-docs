# Common Use Cases

# Available Tools Example

To illustrate how these tools work together, consider a financial services firm with access to the following Moody’s MCP tools:

Entity Tools:

# Credit Analysis for Portfolio Management

Example input prompt:

```
Analyze the credit profile of XYZ Corporation. What’s their current
rating, what factors could trigger a downgrade, and are there any recent
research reports I should review?
```

For this analysis, Claude might use the following workflow:

1. **Entity Discovery:** Use findEntity to locate XYZ Corporation and retrieve its unique Moody’s entity ID.
2. **Rating Retrieval:** Call getEntityRatings to retrieve the current credit rating, outlook, and rating date.
3. **Risk Factor Analysis:** Execute getEntityRatingDrivers to identify the key factors that could lead to rating upgrades or downgrades.
4. **Rating Methodology:** Use getEntityScorecard to view the detailed scorecard showing how Moody’s evaluates this entity across different factors.
5. **Research Review:** Call searchEntityDocuments to find recent research reports, sector analyses, or rating action commentaries.

Claude might then provide a comprehensive credit analysis including the current rating, key risk factors to monitor, and relevant insights from Moody’s research.

# M&A Due Diligence

Example input prompt:

```
We’re evaluating an acquisition of ABC Manufacturing. What’s their credit
standing, and how does it compare to their sector peers? Include relevant
research on industry trends.
```

To complete this request, Claude might follow this workflow:

1. **Target Analysis:** Use findEntity and getEntityRatings to establish the target’s creditworthiness.
2. **Rating Factors:** Call getEntityScorecard and getEntityRatingDrivers to understand the underlying credit fundamentals and potential risks.
3. **Sector Context:** Execute searchEntityDocuments with sector-specific queries to find research on industry trends, peer comparisons, and market outlook.
4. **Synthesis:** Combine ratings, scorecard metrics, and research insights to provide a comprehensive view of the target’s credit profile and sector positioning.

Claude would then respond with a due diligence summary including credit ratings, key risk factors, sector positioning, and relevant research findings.

# Investment Portfolio Monitoring

Example input prompt:

```
Monitor my portfolio holdings for any rating changes or negative rating
drivers. My holdings include: Company A, Company B, and Company C.
```

For this task, Claude might use the following approach:

1. **Entity Identification:** Use findEntity to locate each portfolio company in Moody’s database.
2. **Rating Status:** Call getEntityRatings for each holding to check current ratings and outlooks.
3. **Risk Assessment:** Execute getEntityRatingDrivers for holdings with negative outlooks or recent rating changes to identify specific risk factors.
4. **Research Updates:** Use searchEntityDocuments to find any recent research publications or rating action commentaries for companies showing credit stress.

Claude might then respond with a portfolio monitoring report highlighting any rating changes, companies on negative watch, and key risk factors requiring attention.

# Counterparty Risk Assessment

Example input prompt:

```
We’re entering a large trade with DEF Bank. Assess their credit quality
and identify any factors that could impact their creditworthiness over the
next 12 months.
```

For this assessment, Claude might follow these steps:

1. **Entity Lookup:** Use findEntity to locate DEF Bank in Moody’s coverage universe.
2. **Credit Profile:** Call getEntityRatings to retrieve current ratings and outlook.
3. **Rating Analysis:** Execute getEntityScorecard to review the bank’s financial strength across key metrics like capital adequacy, asset quality, and liquidity.
4. **Forward-Looking Factors:** Use getEntityRatingDrivers to identify specific factors that could trigger rating changes.
5. **Research Context:** Call searchEntityDocuments to find sector research on banking industry trends and systemic risks.

Claude would then provide a counterparty risk assessment including current credit standing, key vulnerabilities, and forward-looking risk factors.

# Tips for Using Moody’s

* Be specific about entities: When searching for entities, include relevant identifiers like ticker symbols, full legal names, or location information for more accurate results.

  + Example: Instead of “Apple”, try “Apple Inc. (AAPL)”
* Leverage rating drivers for forward-looking analysis: The rating upgrade/downgrade factors provide valuable insights into what could change an entity’s credit profile.

  + Example: “What factors would lead to a downgrade of Company X’s rating?”
* Combine tools for comprehensive analysis: Use multiple tools together to build complete credit profiles. Start with ratings, then examine scorecards and drivers, and supplement with research.
* Access is governed by your Moody’s subscription: Claude can only access data and research that your Moody’s account has permission to view. The connector respects your subscription entitlements.
* Use research search for sector insights: The document search isn’t limited to individual entities. Search by sector, theme, or risk type to find broader market analysis.

  + Example: “Find Moody’s research on renewable energy sector credit trends”
* Rating scorecards provide methodology transparency: Review scorecards to understand how Moody’s weighs different factors in their rating assessment, which can inform your own credit analysis framework.
