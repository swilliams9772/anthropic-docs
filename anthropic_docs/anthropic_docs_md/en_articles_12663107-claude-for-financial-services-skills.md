# How to use these Skills

Claude for Financial Services Skills work automatically when relevant to your task. You don’t need to explicitly invoke them—Claude determines when each Skill is needed based on your request.

For example, if you ask Claude to “Create a DCF model for Company XYZ,” Claude will automatically use the DCF modeling Skill. Similarly, asking for “comps analysis for ABC Corp” will trigger the comps analysis Skill.

To guarantee Claude uses the skill, you are also welcome to explicitly instruct Claude to use the skill. For example, append “please use DCF skill” to the prompt.

# Best Practices

* **Be specific about your requirements:** Clearly state the company name, analysis type, and any specific parameters you need.
* **Provide context:** Share relevant details like industry, time period, or specific metrics you want to focus on.
* **Review and refine:** After Claude generates output using a Skill, you can ask for adjustments or additional analysis.
* **Leverage multiple Skills:** Many workflows benefit from using several Skills together—for example, using the research Skill to initiate coverage, then the DCF Skill for valuation.
