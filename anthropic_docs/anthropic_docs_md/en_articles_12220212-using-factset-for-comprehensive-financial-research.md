# Common Use Cases

# Comprehensive Equity Research

```
Using FactSet, create a complete analysis of Apple (AAPL) including 5-year
price performance with total returns, latest quarterly fundamentals versus
prior year, consensus estimates for next fiscal year, and recent insider
transaction activity. Compare key metrics to Microsoft and Google as peer
benchmarks.
```

This request uses multiple FactSet datasets to build a complete equity research report. Claude retrieves historical pricing to show performance trends, pulls standardized fundamentals for year-over-year comparisons, incorporates forward-looking consensus estimates, and adds governance context through insider activity. The peer comparison ensures relative valuation context using FactSet's standardized metrics.

**When to use**: Building investment research reports or preparing for investment committee presentations.

**Tip**: FactSet's standardized fundamentals enable true apples-to-apples comparisons across companies, even when they use different accounting presentations.

# M&A Activity Analysis

```
Retrieve all M&A deals in the software sector over the past 24 months
where deal value exceeded $1 billion. Include buyer, target, deal value,
and completion status. Then identify which acquirers have been most active
and their typical deal sizes.
```

M&A analysis through FactSet shows consolidation patterns and strategic priorities in specific sectors. Claude retrieves transaction data filtered by industry, size, and time period, then analyzes patterns to identify serial acquirers, typical valuations, and preferred deal structures.

**When to use**: Understanding consolidation trends or identifying potential acquirers and targets.

**Note**: Deal data includes both completed and pending transactions, with status indicators showing which deals closed successfully versus those that were terminated.

# Earnings Surprise Analysis

```
For the last 8 quarters, show me Netflix's reported EPS versus consensus
estimates, calculating the surprise percentage and direction. Include the
stock's price reaction in the 3 days following each announcement to
understand how the market responded to surprises.
```

Earnings surprise analysis combines FactSet's expectations data with actual reported results and subsequent price movements. Claude can identify whether companies beat or missed expectations and calculate the magnitude of the surprise. The integration provides historical earnings performance data alongside corresponding stock price changes, enabling analysis of earnings sensitivity patterns.

**When to use**: Evaluating management credibility and understanding market expectations.

**Key benefit**: Combines estimate data with price reactions for complete surprise impact analysis, showing not just the surprise but how the market interpreted it.

# Ownership and Insider Tracking

```
Show me the top 20 institutional holders of Tesla, their current
positions, and changes over the last quarter. Also pull any insider
transactions over $1 million in the past 6 months, noting whether
executives were buying or selling.
```

Claude retrieves institutional holdings data showing position sizes and changes by investment managers, mutual funds, and other institutional investors. The integration also tracks insider transactions, documenting when executives and directors buy or sell shares in their companies. These datasets show ownership changes over time, though institutional data typically reflects quarterly filing cycles rather than current positions.

**When to use**: Understanding investor sentiment and management confidence.

**Note**: Ownership data typically has a quarterly lag due to filing requirements, so positions shown may not reflect current holdings.

# Supply Chain Risk Assessment

```
Map NVIDIA's key suppliers, customers, and partners from FactSet's
relationship data. Identify any concentration risks where a single
relationship represents significant revenue exposure. Cross-reference with
recent 10-K risk disclosures.
```

Supply chain analysis through FactSet can show dependencies that may not be apparent from financial statements. This analysis can highlight risks, potential supply disruptions, and customer dependencies that could impact future performance.

**When to use**: Operational due diligence or supply chain risk analysis.

**Key consideration**: Relationship data comes from disclosed sources and may not capture all partnerships, particularly those below materiality thresholds.

# Tips for Using FactSet

* Specify exact data types needed to avoid overwhelming results
* Use date ranges to manage data volume, especially for daily pricing data
* Note that some data has reporting lags—ownership is quarterly, insider transactions have filing delays
* For complex analyses, start with a subset of companies before expanding scope
* Be aware that relationship and ownership data reflects disclosed information and may not be complete
