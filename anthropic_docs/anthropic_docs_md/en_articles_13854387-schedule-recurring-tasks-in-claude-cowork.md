# Schedule recurring tasks in Claude Cowork

**Source:** https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13854387-schedule-recurring-tasks-in-claude-cowork

Scheduled tasks allow you to delegate work to Claude Cowork by creating tasks that run automatically on a recurring basis, or on demand. Instead of starting each task from scratch, you describe it once and Claude handles it on your schedule—delivering finished outputs like reports, briefings, and summaries every time.

Scheduled tasks are available in Cowork on Claude Desktop for all paid plans (Pro, Max, Team, Enterprise).

# What scheduled tasks can do

Scheduled tasks have access to the same capabilities as regular Cowork tasks, including connected tools, skills, and installed plugins. Common uses include:

* **Daily briefings:** Summarize Slack messages, emails, or calendar events from the past 24 hours.
* **Weekly reports:** Compile data from Google Drive, spreadsheets, or connected tools into a formatted summary.
* **Recurring research:** Track topics, competitors, or industry news on a regular cadence.
* **File organization:** Periodically sort, clean up, or process files in a designated folder.
* **Team updates:** Generate status updates or standup summaries from project management tools.

# How scheduled tasks work

When you create a scheduled task, Claude saves your prompt as the task's instructions and runs them at the cadence you choose. Tasks can search Slack, query files, run web research, generate reports, and more—using any connectors and plugins you've set up in Cowork.

Each scheduled task runs as its own Cowork session. You can review the results when they're ready, just like any other task.

**Important:** Scheduled tasks only run while your computer is awake and the Claude Desktop app is open. If your computer is asleep or the app is closed when a task is scheduled to run, Cowork will skip the task, then run it automatically once your computer wakes up or you open the desktop app again. When Cowork re-runs a skipped task, you will see a notification letting you know. Skipped runs also appear in the task’s history.

For Team and Enterprise organizations, admins control Cowork access through the admin toggle. For more details, see **[Cowork for Team and Enterprise plans](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13455879)**.
