# Common Use Cases

# Post-Earnings Deep Dive

Example input prompt:

```
Pull the transcript from Netflix’s most recent earnings call and
summarize: (1) revenue and subscriber growth discussed, (2) key themes
from management presentation, (3) top analyst questions and concerns, and
(4) any forward guidance provided.
```

**When to use:** Immediately after earnings releases to quickly digest management commentary and market reaction before research reports publish.

**Typical timeframe:** Most valuable within 24-48 hours of earnings when transcripts are fresh and before consensus views form.

# Analyst Question Tracking

Example input prompt:

```
What were the main questions analysts asked on the last three Microsoft
earnings calls? Identify recurring themes and any new topics of concern
that emerged in recent quarters.
```

**When to use:** Understanding evolving market concerns and identifying which business segments or metrics are drawing increased scrutiny.

**Tip:** Track 2-4 quarters to identify developing themes versus one-time questions.

# Management Commentary Search

Example input prompt:

```
Search the last four Amazon earnings calls for what management said about
capital expenditure plans and AWS infrastructure investments. Has their
tone or guidance changed?
```

**When to use:** Tracking specific strategic initiatives or business drivers across time to detect shifts in company priorities or investment thesis.

**Works well with:** 3-6 quarters of transcripts to establish patterns and identify inflection points.

# Cross-Company Theme Analysis

Example input prompt:

```
Search earnings transcripts for S&P 500 companies in the last quarter for
mentions of “artificial intelligence” or “AI.” Which sectors are
discussing it most and what are they saying about implementation?
```

**When to use:** Identifying emerging trends across markets and understanding which industries are most affected by macro themes.

**Note:** Combine with sector filters to focus analysis on relevant industry groups.

# Upcoming Events Planning

Example input prompt:

```
Show me all confirmed earnings calls for companies in the technology
sector over the next two weeks. I want to prepare analysis ahead of these
events.
```

**When to use:** Planning research calendar and ensuring coverage of important corporate events for portfolio holdings or coverage universe.

**Key benefit:** Get ahead of events rather than reacting after the fact.

# 8-K Material Event Monitoring

Example input prompt:

```
Find all 8-K filings from companies in my watchlist over the past month.
Focus on those related to management changes, acquisitions, or material
contracts.
```

**When to use:** Monitoring portfolio holdings for material corporate developments between regular reporting periods.

**Why it matters:** 8-Ks often contain market-moving information disclosed outside earnings cycles.

# Expert Insight Supplementation

Example input prompt:

```
Find Third Bridge expert interviews discussing the semiconductor industry
from the past month. What are experts saying about demand trends and
capacity utilization?
```

**When to use:** Supplementing quantitative company data with qualitative expert perspectives on industry dynamics.

**Works well with:** Combining expert insights with company earnings commentary for comprehensive sector views.

# Tips for Using Aiera

* Use specific Bloomberg tickers (NFLX US, AAPL US) for precise company identification
* Define clear date ranges to focus on relevant time periods
* Request specific event types (earnings calls vs. conferences) to narrow results
* Set include\_transcripts=false when you only need event metadata to speed up responses
* Leverage watchlist and index filters for portfolio-specific monitoring
* Search strategically by combining keywords with date and company filters
* Consider pagination for large result sets - start with smaller page sizes for testing
