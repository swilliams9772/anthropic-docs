Platform

# Choose how you build

Pick the developer surface that matches your approach, and the infrastructure that fits your stack.

# Messages

Direct model access. You construct every turn, manage conversation state, and write your own tool loop.

[Quickstart](/docs/en/get-started)[API reference](/docs/en/api/messages/create)[Client SDKs](/docs/en/api/client-sdks)

# Managed Agents

Fully managed agent infrastructure. Deploy and manage autonomous agents in stateful sessions with persistent event history.
