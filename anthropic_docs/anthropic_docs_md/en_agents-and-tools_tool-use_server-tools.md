This page covers the shared mechanics of server-executed tools: the `server_tool_use` block, `pause_turn` continuation, ZDR considerations, and domain filtering. For individual tools, see the [tool reference](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/tool-reference).

# The server\_tool\_use block

The `server_tool_use` block appears in Claude's response when a server-executed tool runs. Its `id` field uses the `srvtoolu_` prefix to distinguish it from client tool calls:

```
{
  "type": "server_tool_use",
  "id": "srvtoolu_01A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9",
  "name": "web_search",
  "input": { "query": "latest quantum computing breakthroughs" }
}
```

The API executes the tool internally. You see the call and its result in the response, but you don't handle execution. Unlike client `tool_use` blocks, you don't need to respond with a `tool_result`. The result block appears immediately after the `server_tool_use` block in the same assistant turn.

# The server-side loop and pause\_turn

When using server tools like web search, the API may return a `pause_turn` stop reason, indicating that the API has paused a long-running turn.

Here's how to handle the `pause_turn` stop reason:

PythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby

```
# Initial request with web search
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-7",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Search for comprehensive information about quantum computing breakthroughs in 2025",
        }
    ],
    tools=[{"type": "web_search_20250305", "name": "web_search", "max_uses": 10}],
)

# Check if the response has pause_turn stop reason
if response.stop_reason == "pause_turn":
    # Continue the conversation with the paused content
    messages = [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Search for comprehensive information about quantum computing breakthroughs in 2025",
        },
        {"role": "assistant", "content": response.content},
    ]

    # Send the continuation request
    continuation = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-opus-4-7",
        max_tokens=1024,
        messages=messages,
        tools=[{"type": "web_search_20250305", "name": "web_search", "max_uses": 10}],
    )

    print(continuation)
else:
    print(response)
```

When handling `pause_turn`:

* **Continue the conversation:** Pass the paused response back as-is in a subsequent request to let Claude continue its turn
* **Modify if needed:** You can optionally modify the content before continuing if you want to interrupt or redirect the conversation
* **Preserve tool state:** Include the same tools in the continuation request to maintain functionality

# ZDR and allowed\_callers

The basic versions of web search (`web_search_20250305`) and web fetch (`web_fetch_20250910`) are eligible for [Zero Data Retention (ZDR)](/docs/en/manage-claude/api-and-data-retention).

The `_20260209` versions with dynamic filtering are **not** ZDR-eligible by default because dynamic filtering relies on code execution internally.

To use a `_20260209` server tool with ZDR, disable dynamic filtering by setting `"allowed_callers": ["direct"]` on the tool:

```
{
  "type": "web_search_20260209",
  "name": "web_search",
  "allowed_callers": ["direct"]
}
```

This restricts the tool to direct invocation only, bypassing the internal code execution step.

Even when web fetch is used in a ZDR-eligible configuration, website publishers may retain any parameters passed to the URL if Claude fetches content from their site.

# Domain filtering

Server tools that access the web accept `allowed_domains` and `blocked_domains` parameters to control which domains Claude can reach.

When using domain filters:

* Domains should not include the HTTP/HTTPS scheme (use `example.com` instead of `https://example.com`)
* Subdomains are automatically included (`example.com` covers `docs.example.com`)
* Specific subdomains restrict results to only that subdomain (`docs.example.com` returns only results from that subdomain, not from `example.com` or `api.example.com`)
* Subpaths are supported and match anything after the path (`example.com/blog` matches `example.com/blog/post-1`)
* You can use either `allowed_domains` or `blocked_domains`, but not both in the same request

**Wildcard support:**

* Only one wildcard (`*`) is allowed per domain entry, and it must appear after the domain part (in the path)
* Valid: `example.com/*`, `example.com/*/articles`
* Invalid: `*.example.com`, `ex*.com`, `example.com/*/news/*`

Invalid domain formats return an `invalid_tool_input` tool error.

Request-level domain restrictions must be compatible with organization-level domain restrictions configured in Claude Console. Request-level domains can only further restrict domains, not override or expand beyond the organization-level list. If your request includes domains that conflict with organization settings, the API returns a validation error.

Be aware that Unicode characters in domain names can create security vulnerabilities through homograph attacks, where visually similar characters from different scripts can bypass domain filters. For example, `аmazon.com` (using Cyrillic 'а') may appear identical to `amazon.com` but represents a different domain.

When configuring domain allow/block lists:

* Use ASCII-only domain names when possible
* Consider that URL parsers may handle Unicode normalization differently
* Test your domain filters with potential homograph variations
* Regularly audit your domain configurations for suspicious Unicode characters

# Dynamic filtering with code execution

The `_20260209` versions of web search and web fetch use code execution internally to apply dynamic filters against search results.

Including a standalone `code_execution` tool alongside `_20260209` versions of web tools creates two execution environments, which can confuse the model. Use one or the other, or pin both to the same version.

# Streaming server-tool events

Server-tool events stream as part of the normal SSE flow. The `server_tool_use` block and its result arrive as `content_block_start` and `content_block_delta` events, the same way text and client tool calls stream.

See [Streaming](/docs/en/build-with-claude/streaming) for the full event reference. Individual tool pages document tool-specific event names where they differ.

# Batch requests

All server tools support batch processing. See [Batch processing](/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing).
