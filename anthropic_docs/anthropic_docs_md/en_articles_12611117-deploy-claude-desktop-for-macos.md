# Deploy Claude Desktop for macOS

**Source:** https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12611117-deploy-claude-desktop-for-macos

Administrators on Team or Enterprise plans can deploy Claude Desktop automatically to manage installations and updates centrally. Claude Desktop installs to `/Applications` and updates automatically when new versions are released, unless disabled via enterprise policies.

# Available formats:

- `.pkg` - Standard macOS installer package (recommended for enterprise)

- `.dmg` - Drag-and-drop installation

# Download:

* [Universal (x64 or arm64) Claude PKG](https://claude.ai/api/desktop/darwin/universal/pkg/latest/redirect)

The Universal build is compatible with both Intel and Apple Silicon machines and supports all Mac hardware.

# Deploy via MDM

Upload the PKG to your MDM solution (Jamf, Kandji, Microsoft Intune) and deploy to target machines.

# Configuration

To configure Claude Desktop settings such as auto-updates, extensions, and MCP servers, see the [Enterprise Configuration article](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12622667-enterprise-configuration).

# Troubleshooting

# Users cannot update Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop can be installed to either the user's Applications folder or the system Applications folder, which affects update permissions.:

* `~/Applications` (user folder): Users can update without administrator privileges
* `/Applications` (system folder): Users need administrator access and write permissions to `/Applications`, `Claude.app`, and all contained files

For shared machines, disable auto-updates via enterprise policies and manage updates centrally through your MDM solution.
