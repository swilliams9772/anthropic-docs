BetaSelfHostedWork object { id, acknowledged\_at, created\_at, 9 more }

Work resource representing a unit of work in a self-hosted environment.

Work items are queued when sessions are created or when long-dormant sessions
receive new messages. The environment worker polls for work to execute in a
self-hosted sandbox.

id: string

Work identifier (e.g., 'work\_...')

acknowledged\_at: string

RFC 3339 timestamp when the work item was acknowledged and assigned to a self-hosted sandbox

created\_at: string

RFC 3339 timestamp when work was created

data: [BetaSessionWorkData](/docs/en/api/beta#beta_session_work_data) { id, type }

The actual work to be performed

id: string

Session identifier (e.g., 'session\_...')

type: "session"

Type of work data

environment\_id: string

Environment identifier this work belongs to (e.g., `env_...`)

latest\_heartbeat\_at: string

RFC 3339 timestamp of the most recent heartbeat

metadata: map[string]

User-provided metadata key-value pairs associated with this work item

started\_at: string

RFC 3339 timestamp when work execution started

state: "queued" or "starting" or "active" or 2 more

Current state of the work item

One of the following:

"queued"

"starting"

"active"

"stopping"

"stopped"

stop\_requested\_at: string

RFC 3339 timestamp when stop was requested

stopped\_at: string

RFC 3339 timestamp when work execution stopped

type: "work"

The type of object (always 'work')

BetaSelfHostedWorkHeartbeatResponse object { last\_heartbeat, lease\_extended, state, 2 more }

Response after recording a heartbeat for a work item.

last\_heartbeat: string

RFC 3339 timestamp of the actual heartbeat from DB

lease\_extended: boolean

Whether the heartbeat succeeded in extending the lease

state: "queued" or "starting" or "active" or 2 more

Current state of the work item (active/stopping/stopped)

One of the following:

"queued"

"starting"

"active"

"stopping"

"stopped"

ttl\_seconds: number

Effective TTL applied to the lease

type: "work\_heartbeat"

The type of response

BetaSelfHostedWorkListResponse object { data, next\_page }

Response when listing work items with cursor-based pagination.

data: array of [BetaSelfHostedWork](/docs/en/api/beta#beta_self_hosted_work) { id, acknowledged\_at, created\_at, 9 more }

List of work items

id: string

Work identifier (e.g., 'work\_...')

acknowledged\_at: string

RFC 3339 timestamp when the work item was acknowledged and assigned to a self-hosted sandbox

created\_at: string

RFC 3339 timestamp when work was created

data: [BetaSessionWorkData](/docs/en/api/beta#beta_session_work_data) { id, type }

latest\_heartbeat\_at: string

RFC 3339 timestamp of the most recent heartbeat

metadata: map[string]

User-provided metadata key-value pairs associated with this work item

started\_at: string

RFC 3339 timestamp when work execution started

state: "queued" or "starting" or "active" or 2 more

Current state of the work item

One of the following:

"queued"

"starting"

"active"

"stopping"

"stopped"

stop\_requested\_at: string

RFC 3339 timestamp when stop was requested

stopped\_at: string

RFC 3339 timestamp when work execution stopped

type: "work"

BetaSelfHostedWorkQueueStats object { depth, oldest\_queued\_at, pending, 2 more }

Statistics about the work queue for an environment.

Uses Redis Stream consumer group metrics for O(1) queries.

depth: number

type: "work\_queue\_stats"

The type of object

workers\_polling: number

Number of workers that have polled for work in the last 30 seconds. Requires worker\_id to be sent with poll requests.

BetaSelfHostedWorkStopRequest object { force }
