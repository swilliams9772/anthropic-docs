# Common Use Cases

# Currency Exchange Rate Analysis

Example input prompt:

```
What’s the current USD/EUR spot rate, and what are the 3-month and 6-month
forward rates? Calculate the implied forward points for each tenor.
```

**When to use:** Evaluating currency positions, pricing FX forwards, or analyzing currency basis.

**Tip:** Compare spot vs. forward rates to understand market expectations for currency movements.

# Interest Rate Curve Comparison

Example input prompt:

```
Show me the USD SOFR swap curve. Plot the curve and identify any unusual
shapes or inflection points.
```

**When to use:** Assessing interest rate risk, pricing swaps, or understanding monetary policy expectations.

**Typical analysis:** Compare curves across different currencies or time periods to identify relative value opportunities.

# Multi-Currency Bond Analysis

Example input prompt:

```
Price the following bonds using their ISIN codes: FR0014012I5 (French
government bond) and US91282CNT44 (US Treasury). Compare their yields and
calculate the spread.
```

**When to use:** Portfolio construction, relative value analysis, or credit assessment across sovereign issuers.

**Note:** Ensure proper currency conversion when comparing international bonds.

# FX Forward Curve Construction

Example input prompt:

```
For AUD/USD, show me the complete forward curve using AONIA and SOFR
conventions. Display the forward points and implied forward rates for
standard tenors.
```

**When to use:** Structuring FX derivatives, pricing swaps, or analyzing currency carry strategies.

**Works well with:** Custom valuation dates to assess forward pricing at specific points in time.

# Cross-Asset Correlation Analysis

Example input prompt:

```
Get the USD SOFR curve and EUR ESTR curve, then analyze how they’ve moved
relative to each other. Are there any divergences that suggest trading
opportunities?
```

**When to use:** Identifying cross-currency basis trades or understanding global rate relationships.

**Key benefit:** LSEG provides consistent data across asset classes for reliable correlation analysis.

# Real-Time Market Data for Trading

Example input prompt:

```
I’m looking at pricing a currency swap. Get me the current EUR/USD spot
rate and the EUR ESTR and USD SOFR curves for accurate valuation.
```

**When to use:** Pre-trade analysis, pricing verification, or mark-to-market calculations.

**Why it matters:** Real-time access ensures your analysis reflects current market conditions.

# Tips for Using LSEG

* Use specific currency pair conventions (USD/EUR, GBP/USD)
* Specify tenors clearly for forward rates (3M, 6M, 1Y)
* Reference bonds by ISIN codes for accurate pricing
* Define valuation dates when working with forward curves
* Understand curve conventions (SOFR, ESTR, AONIA) for different currencies
* Cross-reference data across tools to validate analysis
