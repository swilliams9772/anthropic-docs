You can provide files to your agent by uploading them via the Files API and mounting them in the session's container.

All Managed Agents API requests require the `managed-agents-2026-04-01` beta header. The SDK sets the beta header automatically.

# Uploading files

First, upload a file using the [Files API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/files):

curlCLIPythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby

```
file = client.beta.files.upload(file=Path("data.csv"))
print(f"File ID: {file.id}")
```

# Mounting files in a session

Mount uploaded files into the container by adding them to the `resources` array when creating a session:

The `mount_path` is optional, but make sure the uploaded file has a descriptive name so the agent knows what it is looking for.

curlCLIPythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby

```
session = client.beta.sessions.create(
    agent=agent.id,
    environment_id=environment.id,
    resources=[
        {
            "type": "file",
            "file_id": file.id,
            "mount_path": "/workspace/data.csv",
        },
    ],
)
```

A new `file_id` will be created that references the instance of the file in the session. These copies do not count against your [storage limits](/docs/en/build-with-claude/files).

# Multiple files

Mount multiple files by adding entries to the `resources` array:

curlCLIPythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby

```
resources = [
    {"type": "file", "file_id": "file_abc123", "mount_path": "/workspace/data.csv"},
    {"type": "file", "file_id": "file_def456", "mount_path": "/workspace/config.json"},
    {"type": "file", "file_id": "file_ghi789", "mount_path": "/workspace/src/main.py"},
]
```

A maximum of 100 files is supported per session.

# Managing files on a running session

You can add or remove files from a session after creation using the session resources API. Each resource has an `id` returned when it is added (or listed), which you use for deletes.

curlCLIPythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby

```
resource = client.beta.sessions.resources.add(
    session.id,
    type="file",
    file_id=file.id,
)
print(resource.id)  # "sesrsc_01ABC..."
```

List all resources on a session with `resources.list`. To remove a file, call `resources.delete` with the resource ID:

curlCLIPythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby

```
listed = client.beta.sessions.resources.list(session.id)
for entry in listed.data:
    print(entry.id, entry.type)

client.beta.sessions.resources.delete(resource.id, session_id=session.id)
```

# Listing and downloading session files

Use the [Files API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/files) to list files scoped to a session and download them.

curlCLIPythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby

```
# List files associated with a session
files = client.beta.files.list(
    scope_id="sesn_abc123",
    betas=["managed-agents-2026-04-01"],
)
for f in files:
    print(f.id, f.filename)

# Download a file
content = client.beta.files.download(files.data[0].id)
content.write_to_file("output.txt")
```

# Supported file types

The agent can work with any file type, including:

* Source code (`.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.go`, `.rs`, etc.)
* Data files (`.csv`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.yaml`)
* Documents (`.txt`, `.md`)
* Archives (`.zip`, `.tar.gz`) - the agent can extract these using bash
* Binary files - the agent can process these with appropriate tools

# File paths

Files mounted in the container are read-only copies. The agent can read them but cannot modify the original uploaded file. To work with modified versions, the agent writes to new paths within the container.

* Files are mounted at the exact path you specify
* Parent directories are created automatically
* Paths should be absolute (starting with `/`)
