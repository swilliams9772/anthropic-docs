Skills are reusable, filesystem-based resources that give your agent domain-specific expertise: workflows, context, and best practices that turn a general-purpose agent into a specialist. Unlike prompts (conversation-level instructions for one-off tasks), skills load on demand, only impacting the context window when needed.

You can attach two types of skill. Both work the same way: your agent invokes them automatically when they are relevant to the task.

* **Pre-built Anthropic skills:** Common document tasks such as PowerPoint, Excel, Word, and PDF handling.
* **Custom skills:** Skills you author and upload to your workspace.

To learn how to author custom skills, see [Agent Skills](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview) and [Skill authoring best practices](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices). This page assumes you already have skills available in your workspace or are using Anthropic pre-built skills.

All Managed Agents API requests require the `managed-agents-2026-04-01` beta header. The SDK sets the beta header automatically.

# Attach skills to an agent

Attach skills when creating an agent. Each session supports up to 20 skills total, counted across every agent in the session (see [Multiagent sessions](/docs/en/managed-agents/multi-agent)).

Each entry in the `skills` array uses the following fields:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `type` | Either `anthropic` for pre-built skills or `custom` for workspace-authored skills. |
| `skill_id` | The skill identifier. For Anthropic skills, use the short name (for example, `xlsx`). For custom skills, use the `skill_*` ID returned at creation. |
| `version` | Custom skills only. Pin to a specific version or use `latest`. |
