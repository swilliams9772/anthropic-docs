| User | Can you help me create a new word for the act of pretending to understand something in order to avoid looking ignorant or uninformed? |

# Example output

How about the neologism "fauxprehension" to describe this concept?

Fauxprehension (fəʊprɪˈhɛnʃ(ə)n) - noun
Definition: The act of feigning understanding or comprehension of a topic, concept, or situation in order to avoid appearing ignorant, uninformed, or out of the loop. It is the pretense of knowledge or grasp of a subject matter, often employed in social or professional settings to maintain one's image or status.

Etymology: The word "fauxprehension" is a blend of "faux," which comes from the French word meaning false or fake, and "comprehension," which means the action or capability of understanding something.
