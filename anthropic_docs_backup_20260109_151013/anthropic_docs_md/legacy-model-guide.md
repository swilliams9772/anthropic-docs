Models with the same snapshot date (e.g., 20240620) are identical across all platforms and do not change. The snapshot date in the model name ensures consistency and allows developers to rely on stable performance across different environments.

Opus 4.1 does not allow both `temperature` and `top_p` parameters to be specified. Please use only one.

# [​](#model-aliases) Model aliases

For convenience during development and testing, we offer aliases for our model ids. These aliases automatically point to the most recent snapshot of a given model. When we release new model snapshots, we migrate aliases to point to the newest version of a model, typically within a week of the new release.

While aliases are useful for experimentation, we recommend using specific model versions (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) in production applications to ensure consistent behavior.

| Model | Alias | Model ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Opus 4.1 | `claude-opus-4-1` | `claude-opus-4-1-20250805` |
| Claude Opus 4 | `claude-opus-4-0` | `claude-opus-4-20250514` |
| Claude Sonnet 4 | `claude-sonnet-4-0` | `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` |
| Claude Sonnet 3.7 | `claude-3-7-sonnet-latest` | `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219` |
| Claude Haiku 3.5 | `claude-3-5-haiku-latest` | `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` |

Aliases are subject to the same rate limits and pricing as the underlying model version they reference.

# [​](#model-comparison-table) Model comparison table

To help you choose the right model for your needs, we’ve compiled a table comparing the key features and capabilities of each model in the Claude family:

| Feature | Claude Opus 4.1 | Claude Opus 4 | Claude Sonnet 4 | Claude Sonnet 3.7 | Claude Haiku 3.5 | Claude Haiku 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Description** | Our most capable model | Our previous flagship model | High-performance model | High-performance model with early extended thinking | Our fastest model | Fast and compact model for near-instant responsiveness |
| **Strengths** | Highest level of intelligence and capability | Very high intelligence and capability | High intelligence and balanced performance | High intelligence with toggleable extended thinking | Intelligence at blazing speeds | Quick and accurate targeted performance |
| **Multilingual** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Vision** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **[Extended thinking](/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking)** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| **[Priority Tier](/en/api/service-tiers)** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| **API model name** | `claude-opus-4-1-20250805` | `claude-opus-4-20250514` | `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` | `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219` | `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` | `claude-3-haiku-20240307` |
| **Comparative latency** | Moderately Fast | Moderately Fast | Fast | Fast | Fastest | Fast |
| **Context window** | 200K | 200K | 200K / 1M (beta)2 | 200K | 200K | 200K |
| **Max output** | 32000 tokens | 32000 tokens | 64000 tokens | 64000 tokens | 8192 tokens | 4096 tokens |
| **Training data cut-off** | Mar 2025 | Mar 2025 | Mar 2025 | Nov 20241 | July 2024 | Aug 2023 |

*1 - While trained on publicly available information on the internet through November 2024, Claude Sonnet 3.7’s knowledge cut-off date is the end of October 2024. This means the models’ knowledge base is most extensive and reliable on information and events up to October 2024.*

*2 - Claude Sonnet 4 supports a [1M token context window](/en/docs/build-with-claude/context-windows#1m-token-context-window) when using the `context-1m-2025-08-07` beta header. [Long context pricing](/en/docs/about-claude/pricing#long-context-pricing) applies to requests exceeding 200K tokens.*

Include the beta header `output-128k-2025-02-19` in your API request to increase the maximum output token length to 128k tokens for Claude Sonnet 3.7.

We strongly suggest using our [streaming Messages API](/en/docs/build-with-claude/streaming) to avoid timeouts when generating longer outputs.
See our guidance on [long requests](/en/api/errors#long-requests) for more details.

# [​](#prompt-and-output-performance) Prompt and output performance

Claude 4 models excel in:

* **Performance**: Top-tier results in reasoning, coding, multilingual tasks, long-context handling, honesty, and image processing. See the [Claude 4 blog post](http://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4) for more information.
* **Engaging responses**: Claude models are ideal for applications that require rich, human-like interactions.

  + If you prefer more concise responses, you can adjust your prompts to guide the model toward the desired output length. Refer to our [prompt engineering guides](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering) for details.
  + For specific Claude 4 prompting best practices, see our [Claude 4 best practices guide](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-4-best-practices).
* **Output quality**: When migrating from previous model generations to Claude 4, you may notice larger improvements in overall performance.

# [​](#migrating-to-claude-4) Migrating to Claude 4

In most cases, you can switch from Claude 3.7 models to Claude 4 models with minimal changes:

1. Update your model name:
  * From: `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`
   * To: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` or `claude-opus-4-1-20250805`
2. Your existing API calls will continue to work without modification, although API behavior has changed slightly in Claude 4 models (see [API release notes](/en/release-notes/api) for details).

For more details, see [Migrating to Claude 4](/en/docs/about-claude/models/migrating-to-claude-4).
