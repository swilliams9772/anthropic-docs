# Building with Claude - Anthropic

**Source:** https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/intro-to-claude

This guide introduces Claude’s enterprise capabilities, the end-to-end flow for developing with Claude, and how to start building.

# [​](#what-you-can-do-with-claude) What you can do with Claude

Claude is designed to empower enterprises at scale with strong performance across benchmark evaluations for reasoning, math, coding, and fluency in English and non-English languages.

Here’s a non-exhaustive list of Claude’s capabilities and common uses.

| Capability | Enables you to… |
| --- | --- |
| Text and code generation | * Adhere to brand voice for excellent customer-facing experiences such as copywriting and chatbots * Create production-level code and operate (in-line code generation, debugging, and conversational querying) within complex codebases * Build automatic translation features between languages * Conduct complex financial forecasts * Support legal use cases that require high-quality technical analysis, long context windows for processing detailed documents, and fast outputs |
| Vision | * Process and analyze visual input, such as extracting insights from charts and graphs * Generate code from images with code snippets or templates based on diagrams * Describe an image for a user with low vision |
| Tool use | * Interact with external client-side tools and functions, allowing Claude to reason, plan, and execute actions by generating structured outputs through API calls |

# [​](#enterprise-considerations) Enterprise considerations

Along with an extensive set of features, tools, and capabilities, Claude is also built to be secure, trustworthy, and scalable for wide-reaching enterprise needs.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Secure** | * [Enterprise-grade](https://trust.anthropic.com/) security and data handling for API * SOC II Type 2 certified, HIPAA compliance options for API * Accessible through AWS (GA) and GCP (in private preview) |
| **Trustworthy** | * Resistant to jailbreaks and misuse. We continuously monitor prompts and outputs for harmful, malicious use cases that violate our [AUP](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup). * Copyright indemnity protections for paid commercial services * Uniquely positioned to serve high trust industries that process large volumes of sensitive user data |
| **Capable** | * 200K token context window for expanded use cases, with future support for 1M * [Tool use](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview), also known as function calling, which allows seamless integration of Claude into specialized applications and custom workflows * Multimodal input capabilities with text output, allowing you to upload images (such as tables, graphs, and photos) along with text prompts for richer context and complex use cases * [Developer Console](https://console.anthropic.com) with Workbench and prompt generation tool for easier, more powerful prompting and experimentation * [SDKs](/en/api/client-sdks) and [APIs](/en/api) to expedite and enhance development |
| **Reliable** | * Very low hallucination rates * Accurate over long documents |
| **Global** | * Great for coding tasks and fluency in English and non-English languages like Spanish and Japanese * Enables use cases like translation services and broader global utility |
| **Cost conscious** | * Family of models balances cost, performance, and intelligence |

# [​](#implementing-claude) Implementing Claude

1

Scope your use case

* Identify a problem to solve or tasks to automate with Claude.
* Define requirements: features, performance, and cost.

2

Design your integration

* Select Claude’s capabilities (e.g., vision, tool use) and models (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku) based on needs.
* Choose a deployment method, such as the Anthropic API, AWS Bedrock, or Vertex AI.

3

Prepare your data

* Identify and clean relevant data (databases, code repos, knowledge bases) for Claude’s context.

4

Develop your prompts

* Use Workbench to create evals, draft prompts, and iteratively refine based on test results.
* Deploy polished prompts and monitor real-world performance for further refinement.

5

Implement Claude

* Set up your environment, integrate Claude with your systems (APIs, databases, UIs), and define human-in-the-loop requirements.

6

Test your system

* Conduct red teaming for potential misuse and A/B test improvements.

7

Deploy to production

* Once your application runs smoothly end-to-end, deploy to production.

8

Monitor and improve

* Monitor performance and effectiveness to make ongoing improvements.
