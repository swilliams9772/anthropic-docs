# Model deprecations - Anthropic

**Source:** https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/model-deprecations

As we launch safer and more capable models, we regularly retire older models. Applications relying on Anthropic models may need occasional updates to keep working. Impacted customers will always be notified by email and in our documentation.

This page lists all API deprecations, along with recommended replacements.

# [​](#overview) Overview

Anthropic uses the following terms to describe the lifecycle of our models:

* **Active**: The model is fully supported and recommended for use.
* **Legacy**: The model will no longer receive updates and may be deprecated in the future.
* **Deprecated**: The model is no longer available for new customers but continues to be available for existing users until retirement. We assign a retirement date at this point.
* **Retired**: The model is no longer available for use. Requests to retired models will fail.

Please note that deprecated models are likely to be less reliable than active models. We urge you to move workloads to active models to maintain the highest level of support and reliability.

# [​](#migrating-to-replacements) Migrating to replacements

Once a model is deprecated, please migrate all usage to a suitable replacement before the retirement date. Requests to models past the retirement date will fail.

To help measure the performance of replacement models on your tasks, we recommend thorough testing of your applications with the new models well before the retirement date.

For specific instructions on migrating from Claude 3.7 to Claude 4 models, see [Migrating to Claude 4](/en/docs/about-claude/models/migrating-to-claude-4).

# [​](#notifications) Notifications

Anthropic notifies customers with active deployments for models with upcoming retirements. We provide at least 60 days notice before model retirement for publicly released models.

# [​](#auditing-model-usage) Auditing model usage

To help identify usage of deprecated models, customers can access an audit of their API usage. Follow these steps:

1. Go to <https://console.anthropic.com/settings/usage>
2. Click the “Export” button
3. Review the downloaded CSV to see usage broken down by API key and model

This audit will help you locate any instances where your application is still using deprecated models, allowing you to prioritize updates to newer models before the retirement date.

# [​](#best-practices) Best practices

1. Regularly check our documentation for updates on model deprecations.
2. Test your applications with newer models well before the retirement date of your current model.
3. Update your code to use the recommended replacement model as soon as possible.
4. Contact our support team if you need assistance with migration or have any questions.
